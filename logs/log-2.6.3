    [PATCH] Tuner bugfix
    
    From: Neal Stephenson <neal@bakerst.org>
    
    In 2.6.2, I noticed that my modprobe.conf line for tuner "options tuner
    type=2" no longer worked.  It even failed with insmod "insmod tuner.ko
    type=2".  dmesg reported
    
    vmunix: tuner: chip found @ 0xc0
    vmunix: tuner: type set to 19 (Temic PAL* auto (4006 FN5))
    vmunix: tuner: type forced to 19 (Temic PAL* auto (4006 FN5)) [insmod]
    
    I noticed that the a line had been removed from 2.6.1 and when it is added
    everything works again.

    [PATCH] Fix radeon warning on 64-bit platforms
    
    Disable the RADEON_PARAM_SAREA_HANDLE ioctl on 64-bit architectures,
    since it is only used on some embedded platforms, and it isn't 64-bit
    safe.

    Fix the dependency chain for I2C_ALGOBIT from the FB
    drivers that need it.
    
    This allows us to have I2C as a module iff the FB driver
    that needs it is a module.

    [PATCH] Avoid bogus warning about recursive dependencies
    
    This allows us to do something like
    
    	config FB_RADEON
    		select I2C_ALGOBIT if FB_RADEON_I2C
    
    where FB_RADEON_I2C itself depends on FB_RADEON without getting a bogus
    warning about recursive dependencies.
    
    This matters because the select takes the default minimum dependancy
    from the parent menu, so we want to do this under FB_RADEON rather than
    under FB_RADEON_I2C (so that the I2C_ALGOBIT config depends properly
    on the state of FB_RADEON)

    [PATCH] blkdev_put() data corruption
    
    	We used to have sync_blockdev() on each normal (== non-raw)
    blkdev_put() + kill_bdev() on the final blkdev_put().  That worked
    fine until we'd moved sync_blockdev() to the final blkdev_put().
    
    	Now we have a nasty scenario:
    
    open block device
    open raw device
    write on block device	# data ends up in cache
    close block device	# no sync here, we still have the sucker opened
    close raw device	# no sync here either
    			# ... and cache is killed by kill_bdev()
    
    	IOW, if we postpone sync to final close, we must do it regardless of
    kind of close.  Otherwise we are in for data corruption and yes, it is easy
    to trigger.  Fix is obvious...

    [PATCH] Fix fencepost error in x86_64 IOMMU
    
    There's a fencepost error in the GART IOMMU handling on x86_64
    in the unmap path.  When testing to see if the bus address is
    within the IOMMU window and needs to be unmapped, the start of
    the first page *beyond* the window also passes the test.  This
    can cause the first doubleword of the next page beyond the gatt
    table to be smashed to zero, with unpredictable results depending
    on what that page is used for.

    [PATCH] mremap NULL pointer dereference fix
    
    This is a cleaned-up version of a mremap() fix for "move_one_page()"
    by Rajesh Venkatasubramanian <vrajesh@umich.edu>. We could use a NULL
    "src" pointer.
    
    Because while we do hold the MM semaphore over the whole sequence, the
    destination page table allocation will possibly drop the page table
    spinlock.  That in turn can cause a clean source page to be stolen by
    page reclaim, causing the source-side "get_one_pte_map_nested()" to
    return NULL the second time around even if it didn't on the first case.
    
    So we just check "src" again, and get rid of the bogus TLB invalidate
    while we're at it.

    permission in order to read the node.

    [PATCH] SELinux: context mount support - SELinux changes.
    
    From: James Morris <jmorris@redhat.com>
    
    This patch implements context mount support within SELinux.
    
    Three new mount options are provided:
    
    context=%s
      Label the entire filesystem with the specified security context during
      mount and change the labeling behavior to 'mountpoint labeling'.  The
      /proc/self/attr/fscreate attribute will be ignored for file creation on
      the filesystem, although policy-specified transitions will still work
      normally.  This also sets the aggregate filesystem security context.
    
    fscontext=%s
      Set the label of the aggregate filesystem to the specified security
      context, so that SELinux policy controls over the filesystem itself may
      be reinstated.  Only works for filesystems without EA labeling support,
      and is not valid if 'context' has been specified.
    
    defcontext=%s
      Set the default security context for files created in this filesystem to
      the specified security context (as opposed to the current global default).
      Only works for filesystems without EA labeling support, and is not
      valid if 'context' has been specified.
    
    To set the context or fscontext options, the security policy must specify
    appropriate permissions for the filesystem relabelfrom and filesystem
    relabelto controls.  For the defcontext option, the filesystem relablefrom
    and filesystem assoicate controls are invoked.
    
    The security mount options are parsed out and stripped from the normal
    mount option data so that no normal filesystems need to be aware of them.
    
    Filesystems with binary mount option data (e.g. NFS, SMBFS, AFS, Coda)
    need to be handled as special cases: only NFS is supprted at this stage
    per the previous patch.

    context mount data.  It allows NFS fileystems to be labeled on a
    per-mountpoint basis, and should not affect existing versions of userspace
    mount.

    allows filesystems to be assigned security context information at mount time.
     For example, some filesystems do not support extended attributes (e.g.  NFS,
    vfat), and this feature allows security contexts to be assigned to them on a
    per-mountpoint basis.  It is also useful when the existing labeling on a
    filesystem is untrusted or unwanted for some reason (e.g.  removable media),
    and needs to be overridden with a safe default.
    
    The first patch below consists of infrastructure changes to the kernel:
    
    - A new LSM hook has been added, sb_copy_data, which allows the security
      module to copy security-specific mount data once the superblock has been
      setup by the filesystem.
    
    - The sb_kern_mount hook has been modified to take this security data as a
      parameter, and would typically be used at that point to configure the
      security parameters of the filesystem being mounted.
    
    - Allocation and freeing of the security data has been implemented in the
      core fs code as it is cleaner than trying to do it purely via LSM hooks,
      and should make maintenance easier.  This code will be compiled away if LSM
      is not enabled.

    [PATCH] Update platinumfb driver
    
    This updates the PowerMac-only platinumfb driver to use the new mac-io
    device infrastructure.  It also switch allocation to the new
    framebuffer_alloc/release and fix a couple of bugs.

    [PATCH] radeonfb: limit ioremap size & debug output
    
    This adds a limit on how much of the framebuffer is ioremap'ed by
    radeonfb, thus enabling it to work with 128Mb VRAM or more on an x86
    with 900Mb of lowmem in the linear mapping.
    
    It also adds a significant amount of debug messages and adds a CONFIG
    option to enable the debugging output, that should help with diagnosing
    new problems. Among others, it dumps the connector info as I understand
    them (so far, they give "strange" informations on laptops, I need more
    data on more various laptops to see if there's a pattern I can really use
    to figure out on which connector the LVDS is)
    
    Regarding the "lid closed at boot", ultimately, we may want to default
    to the VGA output in those cases, though I'm not sure what logic to use
    here. Maybe we could standardize some way for the platform to provide
    this "environment" information to the driver, but i wouldn't rely on it.
    
    More reliably, if we can find out that there is an LVDS output, and
    LVDS is disabled, just ignore the flat panel...
    
    We could assume any mobility chip has LVDS, which is true, but that would
    still cause a problem for laptops with an additional DVI output (only
    Macs so far afaik).

    PowerMac MACE and Airport network drivers.
    
    Both of them are ported to the mac-io infrastructure, all probe code
    rewritting & cleaned up, better error handling & resource management.

    [PATCH] fbcon notified of suspend/resume
    
    This makes fbcon ask for notification of events from fbdev to deal with
    suspend/resume (stop cursor on suspend, refresh screen on resume).
    Could probably do more (like dealing better with the cursor timer), but
    this simple implementation works fine enough for now.

    This adds some "state" information for power management to fbdev's,
    along with a notifier mecanism to inform clients of state changes.  It
    also "uses" this mecanism in the function fb_set_suspend() which was an
    empty placeholder previously, and "shields" various places that access
    the HW when state isn't running.  (It's best to not call them in the
    first place, but the current state of fbcon makes that _very_ difficult)

    all cases hopefully (except if I missed one :)

    converted to it gradually and once all drivers are done it can be

    [PATCH] cleanup debugger hooks
    
    Theres still more to do here, but at least the ifdef mess is gone. No
    more checking for NULL before calling functions, that was playing with
    fire. Oh yeah and lots more deletions :)
    
    Clean up the debugger hooks, it was way too easy to screw up.
    And we did. And Linus hit it.
    
    - create CONFIG_DEBUGGER so we can enable kernel debugging options but not
      have any trace of debugger gunk.
    - remove a bunch of xmon prototypes so no one gets the urge to call them
    - Use die() instead of panic in a number of places, it gives us much better
      debug information.
    - Get rid of the ifdef madness

    - recover from bad SPR read/write (we get a program check)
    - remove some old code (bat and segment register stuff)
    - update the help text to match reality
    - add a "press ? for help" when xmon first appears to make rusty happy
    - protect against flushing bad parts of memory from Milton
    - dont print iseries specific stuff on pseries in SPR dump (S)
    - add code to dump the segment table or SLB
    - remove a number of functions that wouldnt work on LPAR

    [PATCH] Fix ppc64 build problem
    
    From: Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>
    
    Recent changes in include/linux/*.h meant that likely()
    isn't defined here (since we don't set __KERNEL__), and thus
    we don't get some prototypes and we can't use do_div.  This
    fixes the resulting compile errors and warnings.
    
    Remove %L handling from sprintf - we don't need it, and it
    meant we needed do_div from asm/div64.h, which gives problems
    when __KERNEL__ isn't defined.  Also add a prototype for
    strlen to kill a warning.

    On IBM 40x and IBM 4xx (or more specifically, all Book E processors), the
    Save/Restor Registers 2 and 3 Critical Save and Restore Registers 0 and 1
    are logically and functionally equivalent.  And since the 40x is the early
    variant on the Book E model, make generic 4xx/BookE code refer to
    CSRR0/CSRR1, and map these to SRR2/SRR3 on 40x.

    [PATCH] Suppress reiserfs page allocation wanring
    
    From: Nikita Danilov <Nikita@Namesys.COM>
    
    Some stage in reiserfs balancing (fix_nodes() function) has to be performed
    without ever scheduling.  If it schedules, it has to be restarted.  As we
    don't want to restart often, we first try to do atomic allocation, and if
    it fails, GFP_NOFS allocation is done, and fix_nodes() restarted.

    [PATCH] Make serial console work for any port
    
    From: Bjorn Helgaas <bjorn.helgaas@hp.com>
    
    The current serial console code only works for ports that are either
    defined in SERIAL_PORT_DFNS (and set up by serial8250_isa_init_ports()) or
    registered by early_serial_setup().
    
    On ia64, SERIAL_PORT_DFNS is empty because we discover everything via ACPI
    and PCI.  And we only use early_serial_setup() for one port described by
    the HCDP firmware table.
    
    This patch against 2.6.3-rc2 makes it work for any valid port.  If we don't
    know about the port early, we just return -ENODEV from the setup()
    function, which leaves the serial console disabled.  After the driver has
    found all the ports, we try to register the serial console again if it
    hasn't been enabled already.
    
    I think the "port->type == PORT_UNKNOWN" test is cleaner than the
    "port->ops" test -- it more clearly gets to the point of "do we know about
    this port".

    To prevent such troubles in the future, make io.h/core_xx.h included before
    anything else.  Also, this allows to get rid of some duplicated #include's.

    [libata] catch, and ack, spurious DMA interrupts
    
    Hardware issue on Intel ICH5 requires an additional ack sequence
    over and above the normal IDE DMA interrupt ack requirements.  Issue
    described in post to freebsd list:
    http://www.mail-archive.com/freebsd-stable@freebsd.org/msg58421.html
    
    Since the bug workaround only requires a single additional PIO or
    MMIO read in the interrupt handler, it is applied to all chipsets
    using the standard libata interrupt handler.
    
    Credit for research the issue, creating the patch, and testing the
    patch all go to Jon Burgess.

    [SCTP] Use __get_free_pages() to allocate ssnmap.
    
    This is needed to avoid kmalloc()'s 128K limit when an association is
    initialized with a large no. of streams(more than 65000 inbound +
    outbound streams).

    salinfo automatically processes all record types on all cpus at boot

    need for a called_from_init flag on ia64_mca_log_sal_error_record.

    a bit more readable.

    [PATCH] New radeonfb
    
    Here is the new radeonfb. It doesn't remove the old one, just in case,
    though CONFIG_FB_RADEON now builds the new one.
    
    The new driver supports recent cards, has better monitor detection,
    including DDC2, fixes a couple of constants in the old driver, and a lot
    more.
    
    I had to add an empty fb_set_suspend() function to fbmem.c (the real
    implementation is in James tree and will be here soon).  That means that
    Power Management on Apple laptops isn't completely right yet until the
    core fbdev fixes get in, but it's good enough for now.

    [WATCHDOG] v2.6.2 watchdog-architecture-cleanup
    
    In order to make the watchdog menu useful for some architectures, we need
    to only be able to select the watchdogs that can compile.  This patch also
    moves the SuperH watchdog from its own Kconfig file to the normal one.

    [PATCH] Shut up about the damn modules already...
    
    In almost all distributions, the kernel asks for modules which don't
    exist, such as "net-pf-10" or whatever.  Changing "modprobe -q" to
    "succeed" in this case is hacky and breaks some setups, and also we
    want to know if it failed for the fallback code for old aliases in
    fs/char_dev.c, for example.
    
    Just remove the debugging message which fill people's logs: the
    correct way of debugging module problems is something like this:
    
    	echo '#! /bin/sh' > /tmp/modprobe
    	echo 'echo "$@" >> /tmp/modprobe.log' >> /tmp/modprobe
    	echo 'exec /sbin/modprobe "$@"' >> /tmp/modprobe
    	chmod a+x /tmp/modprobe
    	echo /tmp/modprobe > /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe

    [PATCH] open writecount scalability cleanup
    
    This is an obvious scalability improvement for write()s.  We used a
    global lock to protect the inode writecount (updated on every open for
    writing) - this just makes it use the existing inode->i_lock instead.
    
    Compiles & boots fine on x86 SMP.

    [CPUFREQ] Geode register fixes.
    
    From: Hiroshi Miura <miura at da-cha.org>
    
    I mistook a Geode chipset's register meanings. (-.-;
    ON is not 'CPU is ON' but 'cpu modulation is ON' that is stops cpu.
    
    this causes a bad freq setting.
    
    This patch fixes this and minor bug that is,
    
            if (new_khz == stock_freq) {  /* if new khz == 100% of CPU speed, it is special case */
                    local_irq_save(flags);
                    cpufreq_notify_transition(&freqs, CPUFREQ_PRECHANGE);
    
    cpufreq_notify_transition() called after local_irq_save();
    this makes not update cpu_khz.

    [PATCH] ia64: Avoid deadlock when using printk() for MCA and INIT records
    
    Port the ia64 mca.c clean up patches from 2.4.25-pre8 to 2.6.2-rc2.
    
    The following 6 patches do :-
    
    1 Avoid deadlock when using printk() for MCA and INIT records.
    2 Delete all record printing code, moved to salinfo_decode in user space.
    3 Mark variables and functions static where possible.
    4 Delete dead variables and functions.
    5 Reorder to remove the need for forward declarations and to consolidate
      related code.
    6 Bjorn's printk cleanup.
    
    Altogether they shrink mca.c from 2432 to 1339 lines and make it much
    more readable.
    
    The only functional change is the removal of any attempt to print the
    CMC/CPE/MCA/INIT record contents in the kernel plus the addition of an
    info printk to ia64_mca_check_errors(), to match 2.4.  Now we just get
    one line to say that a record has been detected, except for MCA which
    prints nothing at all.

    [PATCH] ia64: sba_iommu perf tunning and new functionality
    
       I've been doing some performance tuning and adding some functionality
    to sba_iommu for zx1/sx1000 chipsets.  This adds:
    
          * Long overdue consistent_dma_mask support
          * Long overdue ability to do large mappings in the iommu
          * Tightened spinlock usage for better performance/scalability
          * Added branch prediction hints for some of the performance paths
          * Added explicit data prefetching to some performance paths -
            perfmon shows roughly a 20% decrease in L3 misses in the bitmap
            search code
          * Increased delayed resource freeing depth and added a separate
            lock per ioc to avoid contention
          * Added code to free up queued pdir entries should we be unable to
            find space for new ones (not that I've ever seen the pdir
            anywhere close to full)
          * Finished cleaning out the hint support code, Grant is
            maintaining this separately for now
          * Added option to control bypass of sg mappings separately from
            single/coherent mappings
    
    Much like the swiotlb, sba_iommu allows devices capable of 64bit
    addressing to bypass the iommu and DMA directly to/from memory.  Using a
    worst case scenario test (64bit bypass disabled, all DMA mapped through
    the iommu), I saw a 60% increase in sequential block input throughput
    using bonnie++ on a large RAID0 MD array.  In fact, this patch provides
    the best bonnie++ performance with bypass disabled.  This is likely due
    to benefits seen from coalescing the scatterlist, allowing better disk
    streaming.  I assume that network performance will likely be limited by
    mapping latency, so I added the last bullet item to allow sg mappings to
    get the benefit of coalescing while keeping a low latency path for
    single and coherent mappings.  If anyone is setup for network
    benchmarks, I'd be interested in a before and after with this patch.

    [PATCH] ia64: fix ld.a emulation
    
    This patch fixes a corner-case of ld.a emulation.  ld.a should be
    emulated such that it always loads a misaligned value and clears the
    corresponding ALAT entry.  The old emulation was correct for the case
    where ld.a was followed by ld.c/chk.a (since ALAT entry was cleared),
    but wrong for the case where it _wasn't_ followed by ld.c/chk.a.  In
    that case, the misaligned value wasn't read from memory, as it should
    have been.

    [PATCH] dm: block size bug with 64 bit devs
    
    With 32 bit sector_t the block device size _in bytes_ is also cut to
    32 bit in __set_size when the block device is mount (a filesystem
    mounted). The argument should be cast to loff_t before expanding the
    sector count to a byte count and calling i_size_write.

    [PATCH] DVD-R capability flag set incorrectly, /proc formatting fix
    
    From John McKell <mckellj@iomega.com>:
    
      This patch for scsi/sr.c and cdrom/cdrom.c persuades
      /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info to report that connecting a drive via USB
      rather than ATAPI in fact does not make it able to write DVD-R.
    
      Without this patch, when sr0 and hdd are the same type of device
      connected via USB and ATAPI respectively, I see:
    
    	$ cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info:
    	drive name:             sr1     sr0     hdd
    	...
    	Can write CD-R:         1       0       0
    	Can write CD-RW:        1       0       0
    	Can read DVD:           0       0       0
    	Can write DVD-R:        1       1       0
    	Can write DVD-RAM:      0       0       0
    	Can read MRW:           0               0               0
    	Can write MRW:          0               0               0
    
      With this patch applied, instead I see:
    
    	$ cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info:
    	drive name:             sr1     sr0     hdd
    	...
    	Can write CD-R:         1       0       0
    	Can write CD-RW:        1       0       0
    	Can read DVD:           0       0       0
    	Can write DVD-R:        0       0       0
    	Can write DVD-RAM:      0       0       0
    	Can read MRW:           0       0       0
    	Can write MRW:          0       0       0
    
      The sr1 device in particular is an ordinary CD-RW that in fact cannot
      write DVD-R.
    
      While messing with this code, I also thought to tweak the /proc
      formatting to align the tabbed columns.

    [PATCH] Export OF device path for PCI devices
    
    Here's a new version of the patch according to our discussion.
    
    This allows the platform to add its own platform files to the
    sysfs PCI device node through a "pcibios_add_platform_entries()"
    call.
    
    I added an empty pcibios_add_platform_entries() inline to all
    archs that apparently have PCI and implemented the OF stuff for
    ppc and ppc64. The name is still "devspec" for now, I doubt
    it will conflict and that's consistent with our use of the
    "devspec" name in other places.

    [PATCH] getxattr error checking fix
    
    From: Nathan Scott <nathans@sgi.com>,
          Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen@suse.de>
    
    XFS regression tests tripped a couple of problems with the recent xattr fix.
    
    When a size of 0 is passed in, the getxattr and listxattr syscalls return the
    size that would be required for the value or list of names, without actually
    returning the value.  The previous patch accidentally removed this test, and
    so querying the required size broke.

    [PATCH] I2C: add new chip driver: fscher
    
    This is a new ported driver, fscher, which supports the FSC Hermes chip.
    The original driver was written by Reinhard Nissl, who also ported it to
    Linux 2.6, as discussed on the lm_sensors mailing list during the last
    two weeks. I reviewed the code and we made the necessary changes, so
    that what we have now looks good to me. Please apply on top of your i2c
    patches stack.

    [PATCH] USB: re-factor enumeration/reset paths
    
    This patch starts dis-entangling some of the enumeration logic by
    moving initialization code into the usb_alloc_dev() constructor.
    Some call signatures changed; a usbcore-internal declaration was
    moved in <linux/usb.h> to a more appropriate location.
    
    With the driver model init now more centralized, it's safer to
    use driver model calls (including dev_info) a lot earlier, so
    the "new device at address N" message now does that.  It also
    reports the device speed, which may not be evident otherwise.

    [PATCH] Fix pc300_tty.c -> implement tiocmset/tiocmget
    
    PC300 MLPPP support is currently marked broken in 2.6.x.
    
    To fix that, attached patch implements tiocmset/tiocmget methods on the
    pc300_tty.c driver, which is the new method tty drivers are supposed to
    use instead ioctl.
    
    This fixes two related issues in the ioctl handler:
    
    - ioctl requesting RTS signal would affect DTR signal
    - The RTS signal is now handled.
    
    Bonus: Throw out unused ioctl handler

    [PATCH] fix OOPS for multiple IDE PCI modules and CONFIG_PROC_FS=y
    
    The problem is that when loading next IDE PCI module memory used by
    previously registered ide_pci_host_proc_list entry is already unmapped
    (because of __{dev}initdata).  This doesn't happen in built-in case
    because this memory is freed after all drivers are initialized.
    Fix it by removing __{dev}initdata from all ide_pci_host_proc_t.
    
    Thanks to Andre Tomt <andre@tomt.net> for help in debugging this.

    Some PnPBIOSes do not follow the specifications with regard to
    disabling devices.  This patch preserves the tag bits, while zeroing
    the resource settings.  Previously we would zero the entire buffer.
    It has been tested and appears to correct the issue while remaining
    compatible with unbroken PnPBIOSes.

    [PNP]: Resource flags update
    
    This patch reorganizes resource flags to ensure that manual resource
    settings are properly recognized.  This fix is necessary for many ALSA
    drivers.  It also prevents comparisons between unset resource
    structures.  The bug was discovered by Rene Herman
    <rene.herman@keyaccess.nl>, who also wrote an initial version of this
    patch.  I made further improvements to ensure that the pnp subsystem
    was compatible with this initial change.

    [PNP]: Fix Serial PnP driver
    
    The serial driver currently fails to unregister its pnp driver upon
    module unload.  This patch corrects the problem by calling
    pnp_unregister_driver and implementing a proper remove function.

    [SUNRPC]: Use completions instead of sleep_on for rpciod.
    
    The rpciod shutdown code gives ugly sleep_on without BKL warnings in
    -mm.  And it looks indeed somewhat racy.
    
    The easy fix would be to simply use a completion as in the patch below,
    but that removes all the signal fuzzing semantics the current code has.
    I don't really understand why we want to cancel the operation by
    signals, but I think it'd be better to leave that to people familar with
    the code anyway..

    and Alpha based platforms.  It is not known to be a problem on x86.

    address a _big_ performance hit on RAID 1 operations.

    NFSv4: Convert the RENEW operation from using nfs4_compound, to
    being a standalone RPC call in preparation for the renew daemon
    overhaul.

commit c2f2ea78e058ca74fe2e674fd8cdfb71966b248c

    NFSv4/RPCSEC_GSS: Make Frank's server->client_sys feature use
    RPC cloning in order to avoid duplicating sockets etc. Make
    NFSv4 share a single socket for all communication to the same
    server.

commit 8d51075e1a0b96f9b787df3e851fec5c9bb2ba4a

    RPC: Add support for sharing the same RPC transport and
    credential caches between different mountpoints by allowing
    cloning of the rpc_client struct.

    RPC: xdr_encode_pages either leaves the tail iovec pointing to
    null or, if padding onthe page data is needed, sets it to point
    to a little bit of static data. This is a problem if we're
    expecting to later append some data in gss_wrap_req. Modify
    xdr_encode_pages to make tail point to the end of the data in
    head, as xdr_inline_pages and xdr_write_pages do.

    RPCSEC_GSS: Move the gss sequence number history from the task
    structure to the request structure, where it makes more sense.
    In particular, when we start storing more sequence number
    history (necessary to process responses to resent requests
    correctly), this will make it easier to initialize the
    necessary data structure in the right place (in
    xprt_request_init).

commit 955ac3514fc5eb754827bd69edbe09012b95beb8
Author: Trond Myklebust <trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no>
Date:   Sat Feb 7 16:44:01 2004 +0100

    RPCSEC_GSS: Client-side only support for rpcsec_gss integrity
    protection. Since this requires checksumming an entire request,
    instead of just the header, and since the request may include,
    for example, pages with write data, we modify the gss_api
    routines to pass xdr_bufs instead of xdr_netobjs where
    necessary.
    
    We add rpcauth_wrap_req and rpcauth_unwrap_resp to rpcauth.c,
    wrappers for the new rpc cred ops crwrap_req and crunwrap_req,
    which are called just before encoding, and just after decoding,
    respectively.

    RPCSEC_GSS: Instead of having gss_get_mic allocate memory for
    the mic, require the caller to pass an output buffer whose data
    pointer already points to preallocated memory.

    [PATCH] fix duplication of DMA {black,white}list in icside.c
    
    Always compile ide-dma.c if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y, mark PCI specific code
    with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI for now (it should migrate to ide_pcidma.c
    over a time).  This fixes a small bug - in_drive_list() from icside.c used
    !strstr() instead of strstr() so it was missing two entries from a blacklist.

    [PATCH] Fix qla2xxx warnings
    
    On ppc64:
    
    drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_dbg.c: In function `qla2300_fw_dump':
    drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_dbg.c:64: warning: int format, different type arg (arg 5)
    drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_dbg.c: In function `qla2100_fw_dump':
    drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_dbg.c:600: warning: int format, different type arg (arg 5)
    drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_os.c: In function `qla2x00_proc_info':
    drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_os.c:2386: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
    drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_os.c:2386: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
    
    The qla_dbg() warning occurs because on ppc64 size_t is a long.  sizeof
    returns a size_t.
    
    I used %Z rather than the more modern %z, because gcc-2.95 warns about %z.
    printk supports both.
    
    For printing out dma_addr_t's, we really don't know what size they are here,
    so treating them as unsigned long long is best.

    [NET]: Support for lots of netdevs -- faster dev_alloc_name
    
    Convert dev_alloc_name from O(n^2) lookup to O(n) by using a page as
    bitmap to figure out how many devices of that pattern have been allocated.
    This works for up to 32k devices (PAGE_SIZE*8) on i386, more on other
    platforms.  Correctly handles the boundary cases where number of devices
    won't fit because name length is limited.
    
    Adds strnchr to the string libraries since we need to find the % format
    character, but only care if it is in the first 15 bytes.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: Convert error paths in ibmphp to use goto
    
    This patch converts the error paths in several functions in ibmphp to use
    goto to the end of the function to kill code duplication.
    
    It also kills some memsets of pointer members of a struct where the struct
    itself is freed directly after.
    
    This one has 2 modification from the first version: the if is back as
    discussed and one extra long line (>> 150 chars) is wrapped now.

    [PATCH] USB: USB misc OHCI updates
    
    Here are three minor OHCI changes:
    
    * Turn off periodic dma transfers until they're needed.  Extra DMAs
      consume power, and can trigger problems on marginal systems.
    
    * New module param "power_switching" (default false).  Many boards
      will have no problems with this mode.  It makes OHCI act more like
      most external hubs and like EHCI.
    
    * Minor SMP cleanup affecting display-only usbfs statistics.
    
    On one system, turning off the periodic DMAs made two of the four
    active OHCI controllers work in cases that previously triggered
    "Unrecoverable Error" IRQs.

    [PATCH] Char drivers: cdev_unmap()
    
    To recap my argument: the current cdev implementation keeps an uncounted
    reference to every cdev in cdev_map.  Creators of cdevs must know to call
    cdev_unmap() with the same arguments they passed to cdev_add() before
    releasing the device, or that reference will remain and will oops the
    kernel should user space attempt to open the (missing) device.  It's an
    easy mistake to make, and, IMO, entirely unnecessary; the cdev code should
    be able to do its own bookkeeping.

    2.2.13 diff is at the end of this message).
    
    Here is updated 2.6 version without mark_inode_dirty(), which is not
    necessary anymore because its called by "ext2_dec_count()" few lines down.

    [PATCH] ext2/3: incorrect increment of i_blocks when keeping the same xattr block
    
    From: Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen@suse.de>
    
    Here is a fix for extended attributes on ext2 and ext3, reported by
    Stephen Tweedie <sct@redhat.com>.
    
    From: Stephen Tweedie <sct@redhat.com>:
    
    When you have an EA block that is shared between multiple inodes; AND you
    then change an attribute in that on one inode, AND the new attribute value
    is the same as the old, then xattr computes the new EA block, finds it
    still in the cache, bumps the reference count on it (and the i_blocks field
    on the inode, incidentally), and leaves it incremented because we haven't
    changed EA block so there's no need to drop the refcount on the old block.
    
    So *every* time you have more than one inode sharing an EA block and you
    perform an identical write to an EA, you get a leak on both i_blocks and
    the EA refcount.
    
    This is a big problem for symlinks, which rely on correct i_blocks
    accounting to determine the difference between fast and slow symlinks.
    With the leak, you end up thinking that a fast symlink (ie.  one small
    enough to be stored in the inode direct blocks) is slow, so you dereference
    the ascii contents of the symlink as if they were a disk block address.
    That typically results in EIO all over the place.

    [PATCH] With size > XATTR_SIZE_MAX, getxattr(2) always returns E2BIG
    
    From: Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen@suse.de>
    
    The getxattr (listxattr) syscall returns E2BIG if the buffer passed to them
    is bigger than XATTR_SIZE_MAX (XATTR_LIST_MAX), no matter what buffer size is
    actually required.  Here is a fix.  It also removes the xattr_alloc and
    xattr_free functions which are not of much use anymore.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Add readq/writeq and __raw* IO functions
    
    From: Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>
    
    This patch adds those for ppc64, except for iSeries which cannot do
    readq/writeq easily, at least not as far as I know but I need to ask the
    iSeries specialists in Rochester to be sure.  But anyway, iSeries shouldn't
    use anything in fb.h anyway ...
    
    It also add the proper tweaks & barriers to make sure reads are actually
    done right away and not delayed indefinitely (making the CPU think the read
    data is actually used) and add necessary write barriers on IO writes.  For
    some reasons, ppc64 in 2.6 lacked some of these, opening potential races
    within some drivers.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Update PowerMac dmasound driver
    
    From: Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>
    
    This patch was missing from my big merge.  It updates the PowerMac
    "dmasound" driver.  Adds input support for some recent machines using the
    tas3004 coded/mixer chip.  Code mostly written by Renzo Davoli.
    
    This driver isn't (unfortunately) fully obsoleted by the Alsa one.  There
    are lots of reports of the Alsa one not working properly on various
    PowerMac machines, and some people are unhappy with Alsa in general, enough
    to have ported the messy PowerMac dmasound to 2.6 :)

    [PATCH] acpi4asus update from Karol 'sziwan' Kozimor
    
    The attached patch updates the acpi4asus driver to 0.27 through the
    following changes:
    - add support for M1300A, S5200N, L8400L,
    - remove WLED support for certain models, since it is not controlled by
      AML,
    - add LCD backlight switching for L2E / L3H,
    - C99 initializers,
    - generic LED handlers,
    - the output of ASYM method to provide battery state information (might be
      more accurate under certain conditions) in /proc/acpi/asus/info,
    - fix several oddities, various clean-ups and other minor changes.
    
    The patch itself is quite big, which is mostly due to the C99 initializers
    and the fact that diff doesn't like moving code around.
    
    This has been compile-tested in various configurations, the substantive
    changes were discussed on the acpi4asus mailing list.
    
    The code should apply to current bk (both for 2.4 and 2.6). The patch is
    also available here:
    http://hell.org.pl/~sziwan/asus/acpi4asus-0.26-0.27.diff
    
    Thanks to all the contributors (notably Pontus Fuchs) to this release.

    [Bluetooth] Fix race for incoming connections
    
    This patch fixes a racing condition in accepting incoming RFCOMM
    connections. If a SABM command frame occurs in data packet right
    after L2CAP configuration request packet and there is no active
    session yet then the kernel RFCOMM thread wakes up only once and
    creates a new session. But it does not process SABM frame from
    second data packet waiting in the queue. Connection setup hangs
    and the other side is waiting for UA frame response, but the
    kernel thread keeps sleeping. A possible solution is to force
    additional thread wakeup right after successful creation of the
    new session.

    current voice setting. It will be read on device initialization and
    then stored in the hci_dev structure.

    use the "macio" model...

    On G5 machines, we remap the AGP port to bus number 0xf0. XFree
    contains a hack that is unfixable at the moment for getting the
    IO base which is hard coded to bus number 0 (AGP on earlier machines).
    We work around this by passing the IO base of bus 0xf0 when asked
    for bus 0 in pciconfig_iobase on those machines. Bus 0 is the HT
    root and has no IOs, so that is safe.

    [PATCH] I2C: Update I2C maintainers entry
    
    I propose the following update of the "I2C AND SENSORS DRIVERS" entry in
    MAINTAINERS:
    
    * Remove Frodo Looijaard. He isn't active in the project anymore, and
    forwards everythings he receives to the mailing-list. More work for
    everyone, and increased latency.
    
    * Move your name to the top. This is more realistic since you are the
    real maintainer of the i2c subsystem in 2.6.
    
    * Reindent. Spaces were used instead of tabs.

        - test 15, iso OUT testing
        - test 16, iso IN testing
    
    Other improvements:
        - Many tests now support data pattern testing submodes.
        - Use the standard usb_set_interface() call, not its own
          version ... one more API call covered!
        - Converted to use driver model style diagnostics.
    
    And minor fixes.

        and network layer expectations
    
      - handle some deferred ep0 responses better
    
      - support iso transfers (needs fifo size tracking)

    [PATCH] put "kernel_thread_helper" in right linker segment
    
    This fixes the "kernel_thread_helper" function so that it is in the
    right segment (.text) regardless of any other code movement by the
    compiler (eg "-funit-at-a-time").

    [PATCH] remove ide_dma_queued_* ops from ide_hwif_t
    
    TCQ code is host independent so remove redundant ide_dma_queued_* ops from
    ide_hwif_t.  If we ever decide to bring back TCQ support this will fix OOPS
    in ide-disk driver with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_TCQ_DEFAULT=y and icside/sgiioc4
    host drivers (it will also enable TCQ support for these host drivers).
    
    Acked by Jens.

    [PATCH] fix 'cat /proc/ide/<cd|dvd>/identify' hang (CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE=y)
    
    Some devices need more time to become non-busy after command completion,
    so use the same timeout in wait_drive_not_busy() (called from task_in_intr()
    if CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO=y) as in drive_cmd_intr().
    
    Thanks to Mark Haverkamp <markh@osdl.org> for help in fixing this.

    made pd_ready() inlined
    renamed ps_timeout to pd_timeout
    renamed ps_tq to fsm_tq
    renamed ps_set_intr to fsm_schedule
    removed unused pd_wait_open.

    [PATCH] paride cleanup and fixes (18/25)
    
    Moved calls of ->connect and ->disconnect into run_fsm().  The only
    change is that now do_pd_start_io() is ran when we are connected.

    Equivalent transformation:
    	now that all phase functions are called claimed, we can
    	simplify the logics around claiming - new variable (pd_claimed)
    	keeps track of claim/unclaim we'd done.  We check it in the
    	beginning of the loop and do claiming if it's not set.

    Equivalent transformation:

    [PATCH] paride cleanup and fixes (12/25)
    
    Equivalent transformation:
    	* calls of pi_disconnect() in phase functions expanded.
    	* since both do_pd_read_start() and do_pd_write_start()
    	  are always called claimed (as the matter of fact,
    	  all phase functions except do_pd_io() are), we can
    	  replace call of pi_connect() with direct method call -
    	  pi_claim() is no-op there.

    [PATCH] paride cleanup and fixes (11/25)
    
    Equivalent transformation:
    	* new type - enum action.  phase functions return it now.
    	  run_fsm() looks at the result of phase() and does the
    	  corresponding action - next_request(), pi_do_claimed()
    	  or ps_set_intr().

    [PATCH] paride cleanup and fixes (10/25)
    
    Equivalent transformation:
    	* ps_continuation renamed - it's "phase" now.
    	* run_fsm() does what ps_tq_int() used to do
    	* calls of pi_do_claimed(..., func) replaced with
    	  phase = func; pi_do_claimed(..., run_fsm);
    	Now all phase functions are called from run_fsm() and we
    	can start pulling the common code into it.

    	moved past dropping pd_lock.

    	ps_set_intr(), do it the other way round.

    [PATCH] paride cleanup and fixes (7/25)
    
    Equivalent transformation:
    	Handling of bogus requests taken into do_pd_io_start() - we
    	call next_request(0) as we would for any other error.  We
    	need to call pi_unclaim() before that - on other paths that
    	would happen as a side effect of pi_disconnect().
    	Setting variables moved into do_pd_io_start() - they don't
    	need pd_lock being held, so we can shift that outside.

    	* do_pd_read() and do_pd_write() merged into do_pd_io(), which
    	  schedules execution of do_pd_io_start().

    [PATCH] paride cleanup and fixes (2/25)
    
    Preparation to crapectomy - expanded include of pseudo.h, split
    the part of pd_do_request() into pd_do_request1(), leaving in pd_do_request()
    only the check that FSM is not running and call of pd_do_request1().
    Added locking analysis - it's in drivers/block/paride/Transition-notes
    and it will be used on the next step.  Even though the subsequent steps are
    small, they rely on properties of the damn thing and proof of these properties
    is hairy.  Amazing perversions people manage to produce when writing a trivial
    FSM - the code is very convoluted for no good reason...

    	daisy.c used to access the topology list with no locking whatsoever.
    Protected by spinlock, fixed numerous bugs in handling of the single-linked
    list (I'm not kidding - just take a look at the old parport_daisy_fini()
    and weep; it is supposed to go through a simple list and remove all entries
    that satisfy a condition).

    	parport_gsc.c turned into proper parisc driver; instead of scanning

    we do cleanup where it belongs - in parisc driver ->remove().

    [PATCH] parport fixes (2/6)
    
    	We use a new mutex to protect all additions/removals of drivers and
    ports.  That cures a lot of insanity:
    	* driver removals can't hit us in the middle of attach_driver_chain().
    Old code simply dies on that.
    	* port removals can't hit us in the middle of driver registration.
    Again, old code dies on that.
    	* driver ->detach() is allowed to block now.
    	* we are guaranteed that by the time when parport_unregister_driver()
    returns, all ->detach() calls are finished.  Old code did _not_ guarantee
    that (read: was inherently racy since rmmod of driver could race with port
    removal and get driver->detach(port) called after the module was gone).
    	* we are guaranteed that driver->attach(port) won't be called
    more than once.  With the old code that was a matter of luck.
    	* removed piles and piles of braindead code.

    [PATCH] parport fixes (1/6)
    
    	Current tree has all allocated ports on portlist.  However,
    most of the portlist users assume that we only have announced ports
    there and break badly if they happen to see the list after port driver
    has created a port (parport_register_port()) but before it finishes
    the setup (and calls parport_announce_port()).
    	The only place that wants to see all allocated port is
    parport_register_port() itself and only to pick the first unused
    port number.
    	We add a new list (all_ports) and put ports there when allocated;
    that list is kept ordered by port->number.  Ports are placed on portlist
    only by parport_announce_port().
    	Gobs of shite in parport_register_port() removed, pile of races
    closed...

    [PATCH] bmac network driver update
    
    Hi !
    
    I didn't include that with the bitkeeper based PowerMac updates so Jeff
    can assume his role as maintainer/filter of network driver updates :)
    
    Here's my latest update to this pmac-only driver, please apply if you
    are ok with it. The driver now uses the macio infrastructure for
    detection & power management notifications, getting into sysfs at
    the same time.
    
    Ben.

    [PATCH] USB: Update ohci-omap to compile
    
    Following is a trivial patch to update the ohci-omap.c in 2.6.2 to be in
    sync with the OMAP tree. Basically the IRQ name was changed, which keeps

    [PATCH] Fix block device inode list corruptions
    
    I've been chasing a weird SELinux bug which shows up mostly when doing
    installs of a dev-* rpm (ie. creating and overwriting lots of block
    device inodes), but which I've also seen when doing mkinitrd.
    
    It turned out not to be an SELinux problem at all, but a core VFS
    S_ISBLK bug.  It seems that SELinux simply widens the race window.
    
    The code at fault is fs/fs-writeback.c:__mark_inode_dirty():
    
    		/*
    		 * Only add valid (hashed) inodes to the superblock's
    		 * dirty list.  Add blockdev inodes as well.
    		 */
    		if (!S_ISBLK(inode->i_mode)) {
    			if (hlist_unhashed(&inode->i_hash))
    				goto out;
    			if (inode->i_state & (I_FREEING|I_CLEAR))
    				goto out;
    		}
    
    The "I_FREEING|I_CLEAR" condition was added after the ISBLK/unhashed
    tests were already in the source, but I can't see any reason why we'd
    want the I_FREEING test not to apply to block devices.  And indeed, this
    results in all sorts of inode list corruptions.  Simply moving the
    I_FREEING|I_CLEAR test out of the protection of the S_ISBLK() condition
    fixes things entirely.
    
    The existing 2.6 kernel will reliably fail on me in about 2 seconds once
    "rpm -Uvh --force dev*.rpm" starts its actual installation of the new
    inodes.  With the patch below I can't reproduce it at all.

    [PATCH] Fix ptrace in the vsyscall dso area
    
    From: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>
    
    The #include is the part of this patch that matters, so the #ifdef below
    works.
    
    The rest of the patch removes gratuitous duplication due to some strange
    aversion to concision in the presence of #ifdef, the kind that is all too
    common, utterly pointless, and error prone.

        If we don't find the cpu for pxm, search the memblks for it.

    [PATCH] Fix x86-64 boot problem
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@muc.de>
    
    Fix a bug introduced with the last merge that prevented booting with
    CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO on on x86-64.  It would corrupt registers in interrupts.
    This has hit a few people, so I would consider it as a critical fix.

    [PATCH] CDROMREADAUDIO frames
    
    From: Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
    
    2.6 imposes a 64 frame limit where 2.4 does not (just relies on kmalloc()
    failing and limiting frames from that).  That breaks at least on guys app.
    With MSF adressing, it's much simpler to be able to ask for a full second
    at the time, so I think we should just allow that.  So bump the limit from
    64 to CD_FRAMES (which is 75).

    [PATCH] PCI Scan all functions
    
    From: Jake Moilanen <moilanen@austin.ibm.com>
    
    On a ppc64 logically partitioned system, there can be a setup where function
    0 of a PCI-PCI bridge is assigned to one partition and (for example) function
    2 is assigned to a second partition.  On the second partition, it would
    appear that function 0 does not exist, but function 2 does.  If all the
    functions are not scanned, everything under function 2 would not be detected.
    
    This patch allows devices that don't respond to function 0, but do respond to
    other functions to be marked with a quirk and have all of their functions
    scanned.

    [PATCH] Move cpu_vm_mask to be closer to mmu_context_t in struct mm
    
    From: Jack Steiner <steiner@sgi.com>
    
    The cpu_vm_mask use to be close to the mmu_context_t field in the mm
    struct.  Recently some large members were added between "cpu_vm_mask" and
    "context".  I suspect that was an oversight.
    
    Here is a patch that puts the fields close together.  This makes it likely
    that both fields are in the same cache line.  Since both fields are likely
    to be updated at the same time, this may improve performance.

    [PATCH] shrink_list(): check PageSwapCache() after add_to_swap()
    
    From: Nikita Danilov <Nikita@Namesys.COM>
    
    shrink_list() checks PageSwapCache() before calling add_to_swap(), this
    means that anonymous page that is going to be added to the swap right
    now these checks return false and:
    
     (*) it will be unaccounted for in nr_mapped, and
    
     (*) it won't be written to the swap if gfp_flags include __GFP_IO but
         not __GFP_FS.
    
    (Both will happen only on the next round of scanning.)
    
    Patch below just moves may_enter_fs initialization down. I am not sure
    about (*nr_mapped) increase though.

    [PATCH] Use address hint in mmap for search
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
    
    When the user gave an address hint in mmap use it as starting point for the
    search for !MAP_FIXED.
    
    Currently it is only checked directly and when already used the free area
    cache is used as starting point.  With this change you can use mmap(4096,
    ....) to e.g.  get the lowest free address in your address space, which is
    sometimes useful.  For example on x86-64 glibc wants to preferably allocate
    thread local data in the first 4GB but use higher addresses when this is
    not possible.
    
    This can be a bit more costly in CPU time because it may have to skip over
    more VMAs, but gives better semantics for most cases.  Most programs pass
    NULL as hint anyways so it won't make any difference for them.
    
    I did it for the generic mmap and for x86-64 for now.  Also minor white
    space fixes for x86-64.

    [PATCH] proc_check_root() locking fix
    
    From: Maneesh Soni <maneesh@in.ibm.com>
    
    The patch fixes locking in proc_check_root().  It brings is_subdir() call
    under vfsmount_lock.  Holding vfsmount_lock will ensure mnt_mountpoint
    dentry is intact and the dentry does not go away while it is being checked
    in is_subdir().

    [PATCH] is_subdir locking fix
    
    From: Maneesh Soni <maneesh@in.ibm.com>
    
    o The following patch fixes is_subdir() races with d_move. Due to concurrent
      d_move, in is_subdir() we can end up accessing freed d_parent pointer in
      case of pre-emptible kernel. To avoid this we can use rcu_read_lock() and
      rcu_read_unlock().
    
    o This also fixes the seqlock uses in is_subdir() as we need to restart the
      the inner loop with the origianl new_dentry passed to the routine in case
      of any rename occured while we are traversing d_parent links.

    [PATCH] u_int32_t causes cross-compile problems
    
    From: Pratik Solanki <pratik.solanki@timesys.com>
    
    I came across this C standards issue while cross-compiling the Linux kernel
    with gcc on Solaris.  The file gen_crc32table.c uses the non-standard type
    u_int32_t.  It's possible that the host machine's sys/types.h does not
    define u_int32_t.  The attached patch replaces u_int32_t with the POSIX
    standard uint32_t and includes POSIX inttypes.h instead of sys/types.h.

          Roman Zippel <zippel@linux-m68k.org>
    
    This patch fixes menuconfig so it can display help text for individual
    choice group config entries.
    
    Previously it would only display the help text attached to the "choice"
    item.  There was no way to display the help attached to individual config
    entries inside the choice group.  Typically, the "choice" item has no help
    text, and all the useful help is attached to the individual entries, so
    this was a bit of a problem.

    [PATCH] Fine tune the time conversion to eliminate conversion errors.
    
    From: George Anzinger <george@mvista.com>
    
    The time conversion code is erroring on the side of a bit too small.  The
    attached patch forces any error to be on the high side.  The current code will
    convert 1 nanosecond to zero jiffies (standard says that should be 1).  It also
    is around 1 nanosecond late on each roll to the next jiffie.
    
    I have done some error checks with this patch applied and get the following
    errors in PPB ( Parts Per Billion):
    
    HZ     nano sec conversion     microsecond conversion
    1000    315                      45
    1024    227                      40
    100     28                       317
    
    In all cases the error is on the high side, which means that the final shift
    will, most likely, eliminate the error bits.

    [PATCH] oprofile, typo in alpha driver
    
    From: Philippe Elie <phil.el@wanadoo.fr>
    
    Unless I miss something this look like a typo, one user reported to get
    error from the daemon: 'Unknown event for counter 1' (alpha ev6) and the
    behavior was better but not completly sane after trying this patch: he get
    spurious event for counter 1 when enabling only counter 0 but rarely now.
    No alpha box to test this.

    [PATCH] oprofile per-cpu buffer overrun
    
    From: Philippe Elie <phil.el@wanadoo.fr>
    
    In a ring buffer controlled by a read and write positions we can't use
    buffer_size but only buffer_size - 1 entry, the last free entry act as a
    guard to avoid write pos overrun.  This bug was hidden because the writer,
    oprofile_add_sample(), request one more entry than really needed.

    [PATCH] console cleanup
    
    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>,
          Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>
    
    Fix up the console makefiles and logo generation.
    
    1) To make output look like the rest of the kernel build.
    
    2) To avoid make utilising chained rules, and therefore issuing a 'rm
       drivers/video/logo/linux_logo.c ...' during the build.
    
    I have previously submitted a few patches for logo/Makefile, but this is the
    first one that actually address the problems I have seen in a proper way.
    
    And no, I did not like such a simple thing to look that complicated, the
    other option was to list too many files or to use other types of kbuild/make
    magic.

    [PATCH] Zero last byte of mount option page.
    
    From: James Morris <jmorris@redhat.com>
    
    Here's a patch which zeroes the last byte of the mount option data copied
    from userspace during mount(2).
    
    For filesystems which parse mount options as strings (the majority), lack
    of a zero terminator could cause the page to be overrun.  The source code
    comments specify that the maximum size of the mount data is PAGE_SIZE-1, so
    this patch will not affect any valid binary-formatted mount data.

    [PATCH] posix_timers fixes
    
    From: George Anzinger <george@mvista.com>
    
    - Removes C++ comment in favor of C style.
    
    - Removes the special treatment for MIPS SIGEV values.  We only require
      (and error if this fails) that the SIGEV_THREAD_ID value not share bits
      with the other SIGEV values.  Note that mips has yet to define this value
      so when they do...
    
    - Corrects the check for the signal range to be from 1 to SIGRTMAX
      inclusive.
    
    - Adds a check to verify that kmem_cache_alloc() actually returned a timer,
      error if not.
    
    - Fixes a bug in timer_gettime() where the incorrect value was returned if
      a signal was pending on the timer OR the timer was a SIGEV_NONE timer.

    [PATCH] Remove memblks from the kernel
    
    From: "Martin J. Bligh" <mbligh@aracnet.com>
    
    This patch removes memblks from the kernel ...  we don't use them, and the
    NUMA API that was planning to use them when they were originally designed
    isn't going to use them anymore.  They're just unnecessary added complexity
    now ...  time for them to go.
    
    There's a slight complication in that ia64 uses something with a similar
    name for part of its memory layout, but Jes Sorensen kindly untangled them
    from each other for us.  The patch with his modifications is below.  Jes
    tested it on ia64, and I testbuilt it with every config in my arsenal.

    If programs like mount use /proc/partitions to find filesystems based on

    filesystems.
    
    If the problem is that mount-by-label takes forever with removable media
    then surely the "right" approch is the following patch, and then actually
    set this flag on the "floppy.c" device.  (It is already set for ide-floppy
    and sd devices).

    happens.  When an array is started any other way, it doesn't matter what
    value is here.

    [PATCH] Fix deep stack usage in ncpfs
    
    From: Petr Vandrovec <vandrove@vc.cvut.cz>
    
    
    Arjan van de Ven pointed out to me there are no checks on name component
    lengths in ncpfs, so potentially 4KB regions could be allocated on stack,
    leading to the user controlled stack overflow.
    
    It was using variable-sized arrays, so this snuck past the static
    stack-usage checking tools.
    
    As NCP is limited to 255 bytes on components, we can simple limit these
    local variables to 256 bytes, and after this stack usage looks more
    acceptable.  Length checking occurs inside ncp_vol2io, during
    iocharset->codepage conversion.
    
    As a side effect support for multibyte codepages now works as it should,
    instead of returning -EINVAL whenever filename in 'codepage' encoding was
    longer than in 'iocharset'.
    
    Other part fixes typo where atime change updated ctime and not atime field.

    [PATCH] initialise cpu_vm_mask in init_mm
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    Some architectures use cpu_vm_mask to optimise TLB flushes.  On ppc64 we
    are now using a common flush infrastructure that handles both userspace and
    kernelspace (vmalloc) pages.  In order to avoid triggering this
    optimisation we need to mark the init mm as having scheduled on all cpus.
    
    Things currently work by luck (we check for the cpu only having run on the
    local cpu, and the field is initialised to 0), but it would be safer to
    initialise it CPU_MASK_ALL.

    [PATCH] fix blockdev --getro for sr, sd, ide-floppy
    
    From: John McKell <mckellj@iomega.com>
    
    This 2.6.1 patch works by setting gendisk->policy to the correct value
    during initialization as the various drivers decide whether or not the disk
    is writeable.  This patch persuades "blockdev --getro ..." to correctly
    report the read-only state of a newly inserted disk.  This patch applies to
    sr.c, sd.c and ide-floppy.c.  ide-cd.c already has this functionality built
    into it.
    
    Using an Iomega Zip drive as the test case...
    
    Without the patch, I always see:
    
    $ sudo blockdev --getro /dev/sda
    0
    $
    
    That's only correct for writeable disks though.  Only when the patch
    is applied do I see a write-protected disk described correctly:
    
    $ sudo blockdev --getro /dev/sda
    1
    $

    [PATCH] Make naming of parititions in sysfs match /proc/partitions.
    
    From: Neil Brown <neilb@cse.unsw.edu.au>
    
    In fs/partitions/check.c  there are two pieces of code that add a
    partition number to a block-device name:
    
      - the 'disk_name' function
      - a snprintf in add_partitions.
    
    'disk_name' inserts a 'p' before the partition number if the device
    name ends with a digit.  The snprintf in add_partitions doesn't.
    
    This patch rectifies this anomoly so that names in sysfs can be
    parsed more reliably.
    
    
    This has been extensively discussed.  It will probably break the external
    `iostat' tool.  But only for disks whose name ends in a digit, which appears
    to be only DAC960.

    [PATCH] vmalloc address offset fix
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    Paul wrote a patch to use some of the rmap infrastructure to flush TLB
    entries on ppc64.  When testing it we found a problem in vmalloc where it
    sets up the pte -> address mapping incorrectly.  We clear the top bits of
    the address but then forget to pass in the full address to
    pte_alloc_kernel.  The end result is the address in page->index is
    truncated.
    
    I fixed it in a similar way to how zeromap_pmd_range etc does it.  I'm
    guessing no one uses the rmap hooks on vmalloc pages yet, so havent seen
    this problem.

    software_suspend() can fail for quite a lot of reasons (for example not

    not propagate error back to userland.  This fixes it.  Plus
    __read_suspend_image() is only done during init time, so we might as well
    mark it __init.

    check for sizeof (struct link) [if that is not PAGE_SIZE, we have *bad*
    problem, better check early].

    [PATCH] EDD: read disk80 MBR signature, export through edd module
    
    From: Matt Domsch <Matt_Domsch@dell.com>
    
    
    There are 4 bytes in the MSDOS master boot record, at offset 0x1b8,
    which may contain a per-system-unique signature.  By first writing a unique
    signature to each disk in the system, then rebooting, and then reading the
    MBR to get the signature for the boot disk (int13 dev 80h), userspace may
    use it to compare against disks it knows as named /dev/[hs]d[a-z], and thus
    determine which disk is the BIOS boot disk, thus where the /boot, / and
    boot loaders should be placed.
    
    This is useful in the case where the BIOS is not EDD3.0 compliant, thus
    doesn't provide the PCI bus/dev/fn and IDE/SCSI location of the boot disk,
    yet you need to know which disk is the boot disk.  It's most useful in OS
    installers.
    
    This patch retrieves the signature from the disk in setup.S, stores it in a
    space reserved in the empty_zero_page, copies it somewhere safe in setup.c,
    and exports it via /sys/firmware/edd/int13_disk80/mbr_signature in edd.c.
    Code is covered under CONFIG_EDD=[ym].

    'enable' is not documented in Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt So
    remove usage in the only Kconfig file in the kernel tree where it was used.

    [PATCH] add readX_relaxed() interface
    
    From: jbarnes@sgi.com (Jesse Barnes)
    
    Here's the patch to add the new _relaxed variants for PIO read accesses.
    It's been ack'd by gregkh and Grant Grundler, and I think it's ready to
    go.
    
    PCI ordering rules also guarantee that PIO read responses arrive after any
    outstanding DMA writes on that bus, since for some devices the result of a
    readb() call may signal to the driver that a DMA transaction is complete.  In
    many cases, however, the driver may want to indicate that the next readb()
    call has no relation to any previous DMA writes performed by the device.  The
    driver can use the readb_relaxed() for these cases, although only some
    platforms will honor the relaxed semantics.

    [PATCH] printk_ratelimit() tweaks
    
    From: Anton Blanchard <anton@samba.org>
    
    I made a few changes, basically the burst parameter is now in units of
    messages, makes much more sense than the old net ratelimit one.
    
    I also screwed up adding a sysctl_jiffies strategy for the burst parameter.

    [PATCH] bitmap parsing/printing routines, version 4
    
    From: Joe Korty <joe.korty@ccur.com>
    
    1) the version in 2.6.1 is broken, doesn't work on 64bit big endian
       machines at all.  This needed fixing.  I thought it best to fix by
       rewriting the printer/parser with an algorithm that is naturally endian &
       sizeof(long) resistant.
    
    2) I wanted all digits to print, eg, 0000ffff,00000004 not ffff,4.
    
    3) I wanted exactly NR_CPUS bits to print (or whatever the bitmap size is
       in bits, and not have what is displayed rounded up to the nearest full
       byte, as the current version did.
    
    4) The bitmap printer and parser should be part of bitmap.[ch] with syntax
       and semantics to match.  The original lib/mask.c versions did not
       recognize this commonality.

    [PATCH] More 3.4 compilation fixes
    
    From: Jan Hubicka <jh@suse.cz>
    
    GCC now converts sprintf (a,"%s",b) to strcpy.  This lose on kernel as
    strcpy is not inlined and not present in library, so one gets linker
    failure.  It seems to make sense to apply this optimization by hand.

    From: Jan Hubicka <jh@suse.cz>
    
    GCC never inline extern inline function redefined by new body (because it is
    not clear what body one should choose)
    
    parport contains such duplicated functions for apparently no good reasons.
    Both copies differ slightly, not sure whether it is intentional or just
    garbage.

    [PATCH] string fixes for gcc 3.4
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@muc.de>
    
    gcc 3.4 optimizes sprintf(foo,"%s",string) into strcpy.  Unfortunately that
    isn't seen by the inliner and linux/i386 has no out-of-line strcpy so you
    end up with a linker error.
    
    This patch adds out of line copies for most string functions to avoid this.
    Actually it doesn't export them to modules yet, that would be the next
    step.
    
    BTW In my opinion we shouldn't use inline string functions at all.  The
    __builtin_str* in modern gcc are better (I used them very successfully on
    x86-64) and for the bigger functions like strrchr,strtok et.al.  it just
    doesn't make any sense to inline them or even code them in assembler.
    
    Also fix the bcopy prototype gcc was complaining about.

    [PATCH] Fix more gcc 3.4 warnings
    
    From: Andi Kleen <ak@muc.de>
    
    Just many more warning fixes for a gcc 3.4 snapshot.
    
    It warns for a lot of things now, e.g.  for ?: and ({ ...  }) and casts as
    lvalues.  And for functions marked inline in headers, but no body.
    
    Actually there are more warnings, i stopped fixing at some point.  Some of
    the warnings seem to be dubious (e.g.  the binfmt_elf.c one, which looks
    more like a compiler bug to me)
    
    I also fixed the _exit() prototype to be void because gcc was complaining
    about this.

    sisfb is simply broken in current 2.6.x.  This patch updates sisfb to the
    current development version which no less than 11 months ahead of the version
    in the kernel.
    
    Updated includes
    
    - many fixes (duh)
    
    - support for new chipsets (661, 741, 760)
    
    - support for new video bridges (301C, 302ELV)
    
    - removal of all offending fp code (as discussed earlier this month)
    
    - a lot of code clean-up (which is the main reason for its size)

    [PATCH] kbuild: Unmangle include options for gcc
    
    From: Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org>
    
    When utilising the make O=...  option the include options for gcc were
    mangled even when absolute paths was used.  Also remove duplication of
    CPPFLAGS.  They were assigned twice.  [It is still possible for
    architectures to modify CPPFLAGS].
    
    This patch allows xconfig to be build with make O=...  xconfig.It will also
    help development of external modules with absolute paths for their -I
    options.
    
    Note: As a side effect a full recompile of the kernel takes place due to
    changes in number of gcc options.

    [PATCH] ia32 MSI vector handling fix
    
    From: "Nakajima, Jun" <jun.nakajima@intel.com>
    
    To get the vector-based interrupt handling work, we need to give the vector
    number to device drivers instead of the IRQ if IRQ < 16.  It was not
    happening for SCI, and the patch fixes it.  In many cases, the IRQ for SCI is
    9, and the problem was not detected, but one particular machine exposed the
    bug.

    [PATCH] lock_cpu_hotplug only if CONFIG_CPU_HOTPLUG
    
    From: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
    
    The cpucontrol mutex is not required when no cpus can go up and down.
    Andrew wrote a wrapper for it to avoid #ifdefs, this expands that to only
    be defined for CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, and uses it everywhere.
    
    The only downside is that the cpucontrol lock was overloaded by my recent
    patch to net/core/flow.c to protect it from reentrance, so this
    reintroduces the local flow_flush_sem.  This code isn't speed critical, so
    taking two locks when CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y is not really an issue.

    [PATCH] quiet down SMP boot messages
    
    From: Jes Sorensen <jes@trained-monkey.org>
    
    I'd like to propose the following for 2.6.1-mm/2.6.2. On systems with a
    large number of CPUs the number of printk's flowing by for each CPU
    booting starts becoming a real console hog.
    
    The following patch eliminates a couple of them (already sent a patch to
    David for the ia64 specific ones) as well as changes the
    "Building zonelist : X" in "Built Y zonelists". IMHO it doesn't make any
    sense to print for each zonelist since it's run in a for loop running
    from 0 to Y-1 anyway.
    
    The patch nukes a few new printk's that were introduced with the
    scheduler changes to the NUMA code in -mm3, if these are still needed
    then I won't fight for that part of the patch.

    From: Tom Rini <trini@kernel.crashing.org>
    
    The following has been approved by Paul, FWIW.
    
    The following patch makes PPC601_SYNC_FIX depend on PPC_PMAC || PPC_PREP.
    It used to depend on ALL_PPC I believe, but this was (at least
    semi-intentionally I gather) backed out.  The last time this was discussed,
    the only platforms old enough to have a 601 to support were pmacs and
    preps, so it makes some sense to only ask for these machines.

    From: Jes Sorensen <jes@trained-monkey.org>
    
    The following patch sets the IOMMU bounce limit on the SN2 which is require
    to avoid some ISA checks in ll_rw_blk.c causing a BUG_ON().

    flush_scheduled_work() may not be called from irq-context and it is not

    [PATCH] Fix race in sched_exit()
    
    From: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
    
    Fix a race on sleep_avg in sched_exit().
    
    The symptom I saw on 64-bit s390 has been a fixpoint divide exception
    because sleep_avg had a value > NS_MAX_SLEEP_AVG.  I tracked it down and
    the problem is sched_exit which recalculates the parents sleep average
    without taking the runqueue lock.  schedule() subtracts run_time from
    sleep_avg of the previous process.  This can turn out negative and is
    corrected shortly after the subtraction but that is already too late.
    sched_exit() already read the negative value an miscalculated the parents
    sleep_avg -> bang.
    
    I fixed this by adding task_rq_lock/task_rq_unlock to sched_exit().

    You're right that the class device isn't currently unregistered, and
    that was an oversight in the patch I originally sent.  Attatched is a
    patch that remedies that situation.  pci_remove_bus_device() *is* the
    natural place to unregister the class_dev, and that's just what the
    patch does.

    Yep.  The patch pulls the kfree() out of pci_remove_bus_device() and
    calls class_device_unregister() in it's place.  This will put() the
    bridge device and free the pci_bus as needed.  put() does need to be
    called twice because the bridge device is get()'d twice: once when the
    device is registered and once when it's bus device grabs a reference to it.

    [netdrvr e1000] 82547 interrupt assert/de-assert re-ordering
    
    * 82547 needs interrupt disable/enable to keep interrupt assertion
      state synced between 82547 and APIC.  82547 will re-order
      assert and de-assert messages if hub link bus is busy (heavy
      traffic).  Disabling interrupt on device works around re-
      order issue.  Note: this is a re-patch.  We backed out the
      patch because of a report on a system with a 8086:1019 device
      would lock up with this patch.  Turns out that system was a
      pre-production sample.

      queue even though no work was queued, and all work completed
      has been cleaned up.  Scenario requires ring to be completely
      filled, which is more likely to happen with TSO, since each
      TSO send consumes multiple ring entries.

    time not line wrapped. Really. Absolutely sure. Checked twice.

    This patch kills the variable hpcrc from many places. It is used as a

    contains the "real" return code. There are some checks if to copy or not
    but at the end they will always have the same value, so we can directly
    put the return code in rc and kill hpcrc.

    complete exchange on the sensors mailing-list for details.

    [PATCH] I2C: Handle read errors in w83l785ts
    
    Here is a patch that adds proper read error handling in the w83l785ts
    driver. This is needed for this driver because on many Asus boards the
    BIOS or something accesses the chip in our back and causes collisions or
    something similar that causes many read errors. For now, these errors
    make the driver return temperature values of -1 from times to times.
    
    I have been working with James Bolt on this. See the thread on the
    lm_sensors mailing list for details. The patch is fairly well tested. It
    is against 2.6.2-rc3 + your current stack of patches as I know it.
    
    The "retry until it works" method is the best I could think of, since we
    have no information from Asus and I don't expect to get any. If it still
    doesn't work after an arbitrary number (5) of tries it returns the
    previously known value and generates an error in the logs. James' tests
    showed that it will probably never happen though (highest retry count
    was 3 and happened once out of 3000 reads) unless we lower the arbitrary
    number (but we don't want to, do we?)
    
    I inserted incremental delays as reads fail, I felt like it should help
    avoid collisions with whatever-is-bugging-us. Seems to work OK, but it's
    not perfect (since we sometimes need 3 retries) and I didn't test with a
    different policy (no delay, constant delay or different increment).

    SCSI: BusLogic update
    
    From: Bob Doyle <doyle@primenet.com>
    
    Deleted dead code:
    - BusLogic_ReportTargetDeviceInfo()
    - BusLogic_SelectQueueDepths()
    - BusLogic_SendBusDeviceReset()
    - BusLogic_ResetCommand()
    
    Fixed:
    - removed dependency on "scsi_obsolete.h"
      o Changes to BusLogic_ResetHostAdapter()
      o Changes to BusLogic_AbortCommand()
    - removed the gratuitous typedefs per Christoph's comments
    - several functions with incorrect __init and __exit sections.
    - Removed vestiges of the 'Error Recovery' command line function (which
      is fundamentally incompatible with the new EH design).
    
    Left to do:
    - Test eh_abort_handler
    - Test eh_host_reset_handler
    - Test as module
    - Straighten out FlashPoint conditional compile so it doesn't
      require #include "FlashPoint.c".
    - Please ignore the long line length and the very lengthy
      identifiers (for now).

    [PATCH] add scsi_cmd_ioctl (SG_IO) support for st
    
    Add SG_IO support for st, so we can send scsi commands directly to an st
    device.
    
    Though st (still?) needs to move to move away from cdev for udev to
    function with it.

    [PATCH] change scsi_cmd_ioctl to take a gendisk instead of a queue
    
    This patch against a recent bk 2.6 changes scsi_cmd_ioctl to take a
    gendisk as an argument instead of a request_queue_t. This allows scsi char
    devices to use the scsi_cmd_ioctl interface.
    
    In turn, change bio_map_user to also pass a request_queue_t, and add a
    __bio_add_page helper that takes a request_queue_t.
    
    Tested ide cd burning with no problems.
    
    If the scsi upper level scsi_cmd_ioctl usage were consolidated in
    scsi_prep_fn, we could pass a request_queue_t instead of a gendisk to
    scsi_cmd_ioctl.

    [PATCH] PCI: Patch to get cpqphp working with IOAPIC
    
    Here is a patch for to get cpqphp working with IOAPIC.
    My earlier statement that a kernel patch is not needed for 2.6 is
    true only when ACPI is enabled.  A similar patch is needed in
    pcibios_enable_irq() for 2.4 kernel and I will send it out
    later.
    
    The fix is in pirq_enable_irq().  This function is called indirectly
    by pci_enable_device().  For device present during boot up, it should
    get the proper dev->irq for pcibios_fixup_irqs() has been called to
    get the dev->irq from MP table. If the value is still zero, then
    this is properly caused by "buggy MP table".  For hot-plug device,
    its dev->irq is 0 when the pci_enable_device() is called for it hasn't
    gone through the fixup.  Therefore, the code (similiar to the code
    in pcibios_fixup_irqs) is needed here.

    [PATCH] media change check fails for busy unplugged device
    
    If a request is sent through scsi_wait_req the function may be woken up
    from the completion by a function other than scsi_wait_done. This can
    happen as a result of cases that return BLKPREP_KILL in the scsi_prep_fn
    function.

    [PATCH] fix badness in scsi_single_lun_run
    
    This patch against recent mainline bk removes the bogus WARN_ON for
    single_lun devices, and a meaningless comment.
    
    We clear the starget_sdev_user, and immediately blk_run_queue for the LUN
    that just issued IO. Another LUN could race in scsi_request_fn, but it is
    most likely that the last user will get there first, and reset
    starget_sdev_user. If it does not, it will have to wait for the other LUN
    to finish all of its IO.

    [PATCH] Updated qla2xxx driver.
    
    -  Bump version number -> 8.00.00b10.
    
    -  Use down() not down_interruptible() while waiting for mailbox
       completions.
    
            o down_interruptible() is the wrong thing to do here
              (in case a signal hits you sooo do the wrong thing
              and corrupt the semaphore)
              (Arjan van de Ven arjanv_redhat.com)
    
    -  Misc. ISP6312/ISP6322 changes:
    
            o Asynchronous IOCB handling is not available on
              ISP6312 and ISP6322 type boards.
    
            o Firmware type (FLX) desgnation fix.
    
    -  Clean up some extraneous code:
    
            o Remove duplicate call to qla2x00_config_os().
            o Remove unused structure member rsvd in struct dev_id.
    
    -  Create single module firmware loaders for each firmware image
       shipped with the driver (2/2).
    
    -  Create single module firmware loaders for each firmware image

    qla2xxx - Use RIO mode 4 for ISP2100/ISP2200 operation. [3/3]
    
    From: 	Andrew Vasquez <andrew.vasquez@qlogic.com>
    
    RIO mode 3 (originally used in the qla2xxx driver) will not work on
    big-endian platforms due to the firmware returning only the first-word
    of the dword command handle returned after SCSI completion.  Use RIO
    mode 4 since full 32bit handle is returned during status.
    
    I've recently added an IBM p630 machine (ppc64) to my test ring with a
    mix of 2200 and 2300 cards -- I feel fairly confident that most endian
    type issues are addressed.

    qla2xxx - perform proper SNS scans with ISP2200 HBAs. [1/3]
    
    From: 	Andrew Vasquez <andrew.vasquez@qlogic.com>
    
    The 2200 firmware doesn't support the MS IOCB interface the driver
    uses to issue CT commands to the SNS.  Basically, I had to
    forward-port some code from the 6.x driver to get the SNS calls
    to go through.  I've had several machines (mixture of 2200s/
    2300s/others with loop and fabric connections) running with this
    patch for the past week.

    [ACPI] add _PDC support
    
    Add support for _PDC to the ACPI processor "Performance States library"
    (perflib). If this field is empty, a bogus entry is passed to the _PDC
    method so that the default (io) access is returned again. This patch
    is partly based on David Moore's patch to
    arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi.c, sent to the cpufreq mailing list on
    June 24th, 2003.

    [PATCH] USB: remove pci_unmap_single() calls from usbcore
    
    There's an unnecessary pci-ism in usbcore -- just an oversight
    in some API conversion, and harmless on most systems.  This'll
    be a good thing to remove for non-PCI HCD support though.

    Here's a new version, incorporating these comments, and making a few more
    changes:
      - Use struct definition in <asm/hydra.h> instead of #defined offset
      - Remove flushes are register writes, they are no longer needed
      - Use pci_resource_start() instead of dev->resource[].start
      - ioremap() the whole resource instead of the first 256 bytes
      - Check for errors returned by ioremap() and i2c_bit_add_bus()
      - Add resource management
      - Call iounmap() in hydra_remove() instead of in i2c_hydra_exit()
      - Let I2C_HYDRA depend on I2C and select I2C_ALGOBIT instead of depending on
        I2C_ALGOBIT

    [PATCH] PCI: Remove uneeded resource structures from pci_dev
    
    The following patch remove irq_resource and dma_resource from pci_dev.  It
    appears that the serial pci driver depends on irq_resource, however, it may be
    broken portions of an old quirk.  I attempted to maintain the existing behavior
    while removing irq_resource.  I changed FL_IRQRESOURCE to FL_NOIRQ.  Russell,
    could you provide any comments?  irq_resource and dma_resource are most likely
    remnants from when pci_dev was shared with pnp.

    in hub_clear_tt_buffer, the value USB_DIR_IN | USB_RECIP_OTHER is used
    for bmRequestType, when section 11.24.2 of the spec says it should
    really be USB_RT_PORT, or 00100011b.
    
    After limited testing, this change exhibited better recovery from TT
    errors, here's the patch :

    [ACPI] remove unnecessary check in acpi-cpufreq driver
    from Dominik Brodowski
    
    The acpi cpufreq driver includes a test at startup which detects whether
    ACPI P-States are supported on any CPU, and whether transitions work.
    However, this test is faulty: it is only run _after_ the acpi driver is
    registered, causing race situations. Also, it doesn't save anything _as_ the
    driver is already registered. So, it can safely be removed.

    [ACPI] update passive cooling algorithm
    	from Dominik Brodowski
    
    The current algorithm used by Linux ACPI for passive thermal management has
    two shortcomings:
    
    - if increasing the CPU processing power as a thermal situation goes away,
      throttling states are decreased later than performance states. This is
      not wise -- it should be the opposite ordering of going "up".
    
    - only if the ACPI CPUfreq driver is used, performance states are used.
      A generalized approach would offer passive cooling even if the ACPI
      P-States cpufreq driver cannot be used (faulty BIOS, FixedHW access, etc.)

    A very simple patch against 2.6.0 follows, which fixes an improper file
    reference in the scsi sym53c8xx_2 driver help text. The referenced
    documentation file was moved in 2.5.48 but the help text was not updated
    accordingly.

    without some flag like GFP_KERNEL). The following patch will fix that.

    [PATCH] aha1542: queuecommand: change panic() to return
    
    From: Timmy Yee <shoujun@masterofpi.org>
    
    The aha1542 driver calls panic() if kmalloc() fails, which it shouldn't
    do. This patch changes that by having the code return a nonzero value, so
    it tells the SCSI mid-layer to retry the command, as suggested by Randy.

    Ouch.  No, of course not, you are right.  Thanks for pointing.  I
    thought I had moved the port testing to aha152x_probe_one...
    
    Following patch cleans that up.
    
    The port test during autoconfiguration was also done without requesting
    the region first and there was a bug in auto configuration of a TC1550
    controller (both even before the patch).

    [PATCH] aha152x
    
    attached my patch for the aha152x driver.  Tested for pcmcia and not
    pcmcia and various devices.
    
    changes in the aha152x driver:
    - gather code that is not used by PCMCIA at the end
    - move request_region for !PCMCIA case to detection
    - migration to new scsi host api (remove legacy code)
    - free host scribble before scsi_done
    - fix error handling
    - one isapnp device added to id_table
    
    and in the pcmcia stub module:
    - default to synchronous transfers
    - release_region hack removed
    - let core module do the scsi host api calls.

    [PATCH] SCSI tape cdev fixes for 2.6.2-rc1
    
    The patch at the end of this message fixes the following problems:
    
    - cdev allocation moved outside st_dev_arr_lock, prevents the debugging
    error messages reported by Mike and Mike
    - cdev_unmap() added before cdev_del(), prevents oops (and kernel data
    corruption) in case someone tries to use a device after removing the
    module
    - better error handling for failures in cdev allocation
    
    As far as I am concerned, the patch is tested but testing by others might
    be useful :-)

    [CPUFREQ] fix up CPU detection in p4-clockmod
    <Dominik Brodowski>
    
    Too many users use the p4-clockmod cpufreq driver instead of the more
    advanced speedstep-centrino, speedstep-ich or even acpi drivers. All of the
    latter (usually) provide voltage scaling, while the p4-clockmod driver only
    offers a variant of frequency scaling. So, warn users if they try out this
    driver instead.
    
    Also, instead of using a local copy, use the speedstep_lib infrastructure
    for detecting the processor speed. Adding the Pentium-M get_frequency
    function to that module only costs about 200 bytes in object size.

    [netdrvr e1000] back out CSA interrupt fix
    
    * 8086:1019 82547 CSA-based LOMs lock up the system with
      this code, so let's revert back to what's in 2.6.0 until
      we can figure out why this is causing problems.

    [netdrvr e1000] h/w workarounds + remove device ID.
    
    * Remove device ID 8086:1014 support: never a production ID.
    * Add #define for stripping CRC on Rx.
    * Added polarity reversal workaround for forced 10Mbps on 82543/4
      controllers.  The polirity detection algorithm check the link
      pulse to see if the polarity is reversed.  The end of packet
      waveform of 10Base-T packets look like an inverted link pulse
      and can make 82443/4 polarity detection algorithms think that
      the polarity is reversed by mistake.
    * Change the condition for applying the TBI workaround on 82543:
      previously enabled workaround if link partner advertised
      capabilities; now enable based on negotiated speed - only
      enable for gig speed.

    [irda sa1100_ir] "resurrect from bitrot hell"
    
    - Don't dereference net device in suspend/resume methods until we
      know the device data has actually been set.
    
    - Remove deprecated MOD_INC_USE_COUNT/MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT
    
    - System devices in their original form are long since dead.  Convert
      to using a platform device.
    
    - Convert to parameters to moduleparam format.
    
    - Use register_netdev not register_netdevice - the latter causes us
      to register "irda%d" as the device name rather than a properly
      formatted device name.

       area (dev->priv) to be calculated as a constant offset from the
       base struct net_device at compile time.

    [netdrvr pcmcia] fix hot unplugging
    
    This patch fixes a deadlock which occurs when a PCMCIA card is
    physically removed, and the netdev interface is then downed.
    
    The problem occurs because these drivers delay the call of
    unregister_netdev until the netdev is downed.
    
    Since 2.6 now downs the interface on unregister_netdev(), we can
    call this function as soon as the card has been removed without
    waiting for the netdev to be downed.

    OK, so here's a additional patch that fixes that:

    Probably, by my mistake in previous mail. Sorry.  This still has the
    races condition. It can trigger the same problem by shared interrupt
    on SMP.
    
    Probably the following ISR style should use the below combination.
    
       in ISR
    	if (netif_rx_schedule_prep(dev)) {
    		RTL_W16 (IntrMask, rtl8139_norx_intr_mask);
    		__netif_rx_schedule(dev);
    	}
    
       in ->poll
    	local_irq_disable();
    	RTL_W16_F(IntrMask, rtl8139_intr_mask);
    	__netif_rx_complete(dev);
    	local_irq_enable();
    
    
    And another one should use the below combination.  (this style can
    change the flags of __LINK_STATE_RX_SCHED or __LINK_STATE_START anytime)
    
       in ISR
    	if (status & RxAckBits) {
    		RTL_W16_F (IntrMask, rtl8139_norx_intr_mask);
    		netif_rx_schedule (dev);
    	}
    
       in ->poll
    	local_irq_disable();
    	__netif_rx_complete(dev);
    	RTL_W16_F(IntrMask, rtl8139_intr_mask);
    	local_irq_enable();
    
       If happen the shared interrupt, the this ISR style may lose a
       chance of netif_rx_schedule().
    
    
    Anyway, the following patch should fix the problem. Please apply.
    
    Thanks.

    [PATCH] 8139too NAPI for net-drivers-2.5-exp
    
    Here is the 8139too version in net-drivers-2.5-exp modified for NAPI.
    Also:
    	64k receive ring - has to handle wrap for that case;
    	   the NoWrap flag does nothing if using this big ring.
    	assert() -> BUG_ON()
    
    To deal with the races with tx_timeout, put back in the rx_lock from earlier versions.

    I forget to test the Sun-3 drivers:
      - sun3_82586.c:
          o add missing casts to iounmap() calls
          o fix parameter of free_netdev()
      - sun3lance.c: add missing casts to iounmap() calls
    
    Note that sun3_82586.c no longer compiles since SUN3_82586_TOTAL_SIZE is not
    defined. Sammy, is it OK to use PAGE_SIZE for that, since that's what's passed
    to ioremap()?

    Here are some (untested, except for cross-gcc) fixes for the m68k-related
    drivers:
      - Space.c: fix incorrect prototypes for atarilance_probe() and mace_probe()
      - a2065.c: kill superfluous argument of alloc_etherdev()
      - apne.c:
          o fix incorrect prototype for apne_probe()
          o kill unused variable err
      - mac8390.c:
          o kill unused variable probed
          o fix typos ENDOEV -> ENODEV and ERR_PTE -> ERR_PTR
          o add missing variable slots
      - macmace.c: use ERR_PTR() where needed
      - macsonic.c: kill unused variable lp
      - mvme147.c:
          o kill conversion warning and kill a cast by making ram unsigned long
          o add missing variable err
    
    Note: The use of `slots' in mac8390.c is not in my tree. Do you know where that
    change comes from?

      PCI layer will do things properly for us.
    * call pci_enable_device before accessing hardware, before obtaining
      irq number, and before obtaining I/O port addresses.
    * remove bogus 'if (pdev)' check in PCI API ->probe function
    * call SET_M0DULE_OWNER, remove MOD_{INC,DEC}_USE_COUNT
    * (cleanup) don't bother casting from a void*
    * (cleanup) mark debugging function with #if 0, just like the caller
    * Fix many printk statements to indicate that tc_readl() returns
      a long, not an int.
    * (cleanup) remove unused tc35815_proc_info function

    [e1000] Internal SERDES link detect; delay after SPI
    
    * Internal SERDES designs must use indirect method to sample
      link status based on sampling MAC sync bits.
    * Need 10 msec delay after SPI eeprom write, otherwise back-to-
      back writes can get corrupted.
    * Allow for setup of multiple MAC addresses (not used for
      Linux - shared code change).
    * Updated comment block.

    [e1000] improve Tx flush method
    
    * Flush queued in-flight Tx descriptors when link is lost.  8254x stops
      processing Tx descriptors when link is lost, so outstanding Tx
      buffers will not be returned to OS unless we flush the Tx descriptor
      ring.  This patch move the flush from the watchdog timer callback
      to process context to work around some issue with holding xmit_lock
      in timer callback.

    [e1000] 82547 interrupt assert/de-assert re-ordering
    
    * 82547 needs interrupt disable/enable to keep interrupt assertion
      state synced between 82547 and APIC.  82547 will re-order
      assert and de-assert messages if hub link bus is busy (heavy
      traffic).  Disabling interrupt on device works around re-
      order issue.

    Based on viro NE32-at1500
    	ROTFL.  The last remnants of CONFIG_AT1500 removed - that was a hell
    	of an ancient bug (at1500_probe() was never defined, AFAICS - all
    	way back to 0.99.15).

    [PATCH] remove dev_get from wanrouter
    
    The call to dev_get() in wanrouter_device_new_if is racy and redundant and should
    be removed.  The later 'register_netdev()' does the same test internally and will
    return the appropriate error if the name already exists.
    
    This patch is against 2.6.0-test6.
    Resend of earlier patch because it was ignored, or missed.

    Compiles ok (with true .o generated, yeah). Please review.
    
    free_netdev() of devices allocated through use of alloc_netdev().
    Though baroque, drivers/net/3c515.c now uses alloc_etherdev().

    deactivate_urbs didn't return the number of still-active URBs when not
    unlinking asynchronously, which would prevent calling wait_clear_urbs
    when some URBs actually are being unlinked asynchronously, so these
    URBs would be freed while still in use.
    
    I removed deactivate_urb's return value because wait_clear_urbs does
    its own counting anyway.

    * There is a user selectable flag droponfull.  Set to 1 and
      any new bytes delivered to the driver after the buffer fills
      up will be discarded until the buffer is able to flush some
      bytes.
    * If droponfull==0 (or is not set, the default is 0), the driver
      proceeds to block further input by not calling
      snd_rawmidi_transmit_ack() and aborting the attempt.  It will
      try again later.
    * I've redone a bit of the interface for the buffer routines.
      This was done to support the proper blocking/non-blocking methods
      as spelled out above, and to try to protect the buffer data a bit.
