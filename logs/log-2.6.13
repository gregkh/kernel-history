    [PATCH] Remove race between con_open and con_close
    
    [ Same race and same patch also by Steven Rostedt <rostedt@goodmis.org> ]
    
    I have a laptop (G3 powerbook) which will pretty reliably hit a race
    between con_open and con_close late in the boot process and oops in
    vt_ioctl due to tty->driver_data being NULL.
    
    What happens is this: process A opens /dev/tty6; it comes into
    con_open() (drivers/char/vt.c) and assign a non-NULL value to
    tty->driver_data.  Then process A closes that and concurrently process
    B opens /dev/tty6.  Process A gets through con_close() and clears
    tty->driver_data, since tty->count == 1.  However, before process A
    can decrement tty->count, we switch to process B (e.g. at the
    down(&tty_sem) call at drivers/char/tty_io.c line 1626).
    
    So process B gets to run and comes into con_open with tty->count == 2,
    as tty->count is incremented (in init_dev) before con_open is called.
    Because tty->count != 1, we don't set tty->driver_data.  Then when the
    process tries to do anything with that fd, it oopses.
    
    The simple and effective fix for this is to test tty->driver_data
    rather than tty->count in con_open.  The testing and setting of
    tty->driver_data is serialized with respect to the clearing of
    tty->driver_data in con_close by the console_sem.  We can't get a
    situation where con_open sees tty->driver_data != NULL and then
    con_close on a different fd clears tty->driver_data, because
    tty->count is incremented before con_open is called.  Thus this patch
    eliminates the race, and in fact with this patch my laptop doesn't
    oops.

    [PATCH] sg.c: fix a memory leak in devices seq_file implementation
    
    I know that scsi procfs is legacy code but this is a fix for a memory leak.
    
    While reading through sg.c I realized that the implementation of
    /proc/scsi/sg/devices with seq_file is leaking memory due to freeing the
    pointer returned by the next() iterator method.  Since next() might return
    NULL or an error this is wrong.  This patch fixes it through using the
    seq_files private field for holding the reference to the iterator object.
    
    Here is a small bash script to trigger the leak. Use slabtop to watch
    the size-32 usage grow and grow.
    
    #!/bin/sh
    
    while true; do
    	cat /proc/scsi/sg/devices > /dev/null

    [PATCH] mmaper_kern.c fixes [buffer overruns]
    
     - copy_from_user() can fail; ->write() must check its return value.
    
     - severe buffer overruns both in ->read() and ->write() - lseek to the
       end (i.e.  to mmapper_size) and
    
    	if (count + *ppos > mmapper_size)
    		count = count + *ppos - mmapper_size;
    
       will do absolutely nothing.  Then it will call
    
    	copy_to_user(buf,&v_buf[*ppos],count);
    
       with obvious results (similar for ->write()).
    
       Fixed by turning read to simple_read_from_buffer() and by doing
       normal limiting of count in ->write().
    
     - gratitious lock_kernel() in ->mmap() - it's useless there.
    
     - lots of gratuitous includes.

    [PATCH] Fix oops in sysfs_hash_and_remove_file()
    
    The problem arises if an entity in sysfs is created and removed without
    ever having been made completely visible.  In SCSI this is triggered by
    removing a device while it's initialising.
    
    The problem appears to be that because it was never made visible in sysfs,
    the sysfs dentry has a null d_inode which oopses when a reference is made
    to it.  The solution is simply to check d_inode and assume the object was
    never made visible (and thus doesn't need deleting) if it's NULL.
    
    (akpm: possibly a stopgap for 2.6.13 scsi problems.  May not be the

    [PATCH] x86_64: Tell VM about holes in nodes
    
    Some nodes can have large holes on x86-64.
    
    This fixes problems with the VM allowing too many dirty pages because it
    overestimates the number of available RAM in a node.  In extreme cases you
    can end up with all RAM filled with dirty pages which can lead to deadlocks
    and other nasty behaviour.
    
    This patch just tells the VM about the known holes from e820.  Reserved
    (like the kernel text or mem_map) is still not taken into account, but that
    should be only a few percent error now.
    
    Small detail is that the flat setup uses the NUMA free_area_init_node() now
    too because it offers more flexibility.

    [PATCH] Fix oops in fs/locks.c on close of file with pending locks
    
    The recent change to locks_remove_flock code in fs/locks.c changes how
    byte range locks are removed from closing files, which shows up a bug in
    cifs.
    
    The assumption in the cifs code was that the close call sent to the
    server would remove any pending locks on the server on this file, but
    that is no longer safe as the fs/locks.c code on the client wants unlock
    of 0 to PATH_MAX to remove all locks (at least from this client, it is
    not possible AFAIK to remove all locks from other clients made to the
    server copy of the file).
    
    Note that cifs locks are different from posix locks - and it is not
    possible to map posix locks perfectly on the wire yet, due to
    restrictions of the cifs network protocol, even to Samba without adding
    a new request type to the network protocol (which we plan to do for
    Samba 3.0.21 within a few months), but the local client will have the
    correct, posix view, of the lock in most cases.
    
    The correct fix for cifs for this would involve a bigger change than I
    would like to do this late in the 2.6.13-rc cycle - and would involve
    cifs keeping track of all unmerged (uncoalesced) byte range locks for
    each remote inode and scanning that list to remove locks that intersect
    or fall wholly within the range - locks that intersect may have to be
    reaquired with the smaller, remaining range.

    There is an off by one problem with idr_get_new_above.

    Ignore disabled ROM resources at setup
    
    Writing even a disabled value seems to mess up some matrox graphics
    cards.  It may be a card-related issue, but we may also be writing
    reserved low bits in the result.
    
    This was a fall-out of switching x86 over to the generic PCI resource
    allocation code, and needs more debugging.  In particular, the old x86
    code defaulted to not doing any resource allocations at all for ROM
    resources.

    [TG3]: Fix ethtool loopback test lockup
    
    The tg3_abort_hw() call in tg3_test_loopback() is causing lockups on
    some devices. tg3_abort_hw() disables the memory arbiter, causing
    tg3_reset_hw() to hang when it tries to write the pre-reset signature.
    tg3_abort_hw() should only be called after the pre-reset signature has
    been written. This is all done in tg3_reset_hw() so the tg3_abort_hw()
    call is unnecessary and can be removed.

    As reported by Paul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>, the previous patch
    "cpu_exclusive sched domains fix" broke the ppc64 build with

    [PATCH] cpu_exclusive sched domains on partial nodes temp fix
    
    This keeps the kernel/cpuset.c routine update_cpu_domains() from
    invoking the sched.c routine partition_sched_domains() if the cpuset in
    question doesn't fall on node boundaries.
    
    I have boot tested this on an SN2, and with the help of a couple of ad
    hoc printk's, determined that it does indeed avoid calling the
    partition_sched_domains() routine on partial nodes.
    
    I did not directly verify that this avoids setting up bogus sched
    domains or avoids the oops that Hawkes saw.
    
    This patch imposes a silent artificial constraint on which cpusets can
    be used to define dynamic sched domains.
    
    This patch should allow proceeding with this new feature in 2.6.13 for
    the configurations in which it is useful (node alligned sched domains)
    while avoiding trying to setup sched domains in the less useful cases
    that can cause the kernel corruption and oops.

    This is caused by unconditionally checking the IS and c1 bits from the

    whether an exception is a stack fault and is only relevant when the
    exception is IE (invalid operation.) The C1 bit determines whether a

    are set.

    return a bogus value if the parent's task_struct gets reallocated after
    current->group_leader->real_parent is read:
    
            asmlinkage long sys_getppid(void)
            {
                    int pid;
                    struct task_struct *me = current;
                    struct task_struct *parent;
    
                    parent = me->group_leader->real_parent;
    RACE HERE =>    for (;;) {
                            pid = parent->tgid;
            #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
            {
                            struct task_struct *old = parent;
    
                            /*
                             * Make sure we read the pid before re-reading the
                             * parent pointer:
                             */
                            smp_rmb();
                            parent = me->group_leader->real_parent;
                            if (old != parent)
                                    continue;
            }
            #endif
                            break;
                    }
                    return pid;
            }
    
    If the process gets preempted at the indicated point, the parent process
    can go ahead and call exit() and then get wait()'d on to reap its
    task_struct. When the preempted process gets resumed, it will not do any
    further checks of the parent pointer on !CONFIG_SMP: it will read the
    bad pid and return.
    
    So, the same algorithm used when SMP is enabled should be used when
    preempt is enabled, which will recheck ->real_parent in this case.

    [TCP]: Unconditionally clear TCP_NAGLE_PUSH in skb_entail().
    
    Intention of this bit is to force pushing of the existing
    send queue when TCP_CORK or TCP_NODELAY state changes via
    setsockopt().
    
    But it's easy to create a situation where the bit never
    clears.  For example, if the send queue starts empty:
    
    1) set TCP_NODELAY
    2) clear TCP_NODELAY
    3) set TCP_CORK
    4) do small write()
    
    The current code will leave TCP_NAGLE_PUSH set after that
    sequence.  Unconditionally clearing the bit when new data
    is added via skb_entail() solves the problem.

    [PKT_SCHED]: Fix missing qdisc_destroy() in qdisc_create_dflt()
    
    qdisc_create_dflt() is missing to destroy the newly allocated
    default qdisc if the initialization fails resulting in leaks
    of all kinds. The only caller in mainline which may trigger
    this bug is sch_tbf.c in tbf_create_dflt_qdisc().
    
    Note: qdisc_create_dflt() doesn't fulfill the official locking
          requirements of qdisc_destroy() but since the qdisc could
          never be seen by the outside world this doesn't matter
          and it can stay as-is until the locking of pkt_sched
          is cleaned up.

    [NET]: Fix socket bitop damage
    
    The socket flag cleanups that went into 2.6.12-rc1 are basically oring
    the flags of an old socket into the socket just being created.
    Unfortunately that one was just initialized by sock_init_data(), so already
    has SOCK_ZAPPED set.  As the result zapped sockets are created and all
    incoming connection will fail due to this bug which again was carefully
    replicated to at least AX.25, NET/ROM or ROSE.
    
    In order to keep the abstraction alive I've introduced sock_copy_flags()
    to copy the socket flags from one sockets to another and used that
    instead of the bitwise copy thing.  Anyway, the idea here has probably
    been to copy all flags, so sock_copy_flags() should be the right thing.
    With this the ham radio protocols are usable again, so I hope this will
    make it into 2.6.13.

    [IPV4]: Fix negative timer loop with lots of ipv4 peers.
    
    From: Dave Johnson <djohnson+linux-kernel@sw.starentnetworks.com>
    
    Found this bug while doing some scaling testing that created 500K inet
    peers.
    
    peer_check_expire() in net/ipv4/inetpeer.c isn't using inet_peer_gc_mintime
    correctly and will end up creating an expire timer with less than the
    minimum duration, and even zero/negative if enough active peers are
    present.
    
    If >65K peers, the timer will be less than inet_peer_gc_mintime, and with
    >70K peers, the timer duration will reach zero and go negative.
    
    The timer handler will continue to schedule another zero/negative timer in
    a loop until peers can be aged.  This can continue for at least a few
    minutes or even longer if the peers remain active due to arriving packets
    while the loop is occurring.
    
    Bug is present in both 2.4 and 2.6.  Same patch will apply to both just
    fine.

    Thanks to Stephane, we've now worked out the real cause of the

    overflow because the stack pointer wasn't being initialised properly
    in boot_head.S (it was being initialised to the lowest instead of the
    highest address of the stack, so the first push started to overwrite

       smbfs, sysvfs, ufs, xfs - prototype change for ->follow_link()

    Fix nasty ncpfs symlink handling bug.
    
    This bug could cause oopses and page state corruption, because ncpfs
    used the generic page-cache symlink handlign functions.  But those
    functions only work if the page cache is guaranteed to be "stable", ie a
    page that was installed when the symlink walk was started has to still
    be installed in the page cache at the end of the walk.
    
    We could have fixed ncpfs to not use the generic helper routines, but it
    is in many ways much cleaner to instead improve on the symlink walking
    helper routines so that they don't require that absolute stability.
    
    We do this by allowing "follow_link()" to return a error-pointer as a
    cookie, which is fed back to the cleanup "put_link()" routine.  This
    also simplifies NFS symlink handling.

    [PATCH] jffs2: fix symlink error handling
    
    The current calling conventions for ->follow_link() are already fairly
    complex.
    
    What we have is
    	1) you can return -error; then you must release nameidata yourself
    	   and ->put_link() will _not_ be called.
    	2) you can do nd_set_link(nd, ERR_PTR(-error)) and return 0
    	3) you can do nd_set_link(nd, path) and return 0
    	4) you can return 0 (after having moved nameidata yourself)
    
    jffs2 follow_link() is broken - it has an exit where it returns
    -EIO and leaks nameidata.

    [SPARC]: Fix weak aliases
    
    sparc_ksyms.c used to declare weak alias to several gcc intrinsics.  It
    doesn't work with gcc4 anymore - it wants a declaration for the thing
    we are aliasing to and that's not going to happen for something like
    .mul, etc.  Replaced with direct injection of weak alias on the assembler
    level - .weak <alias> followed by <alias> = <aliased>; that works on all
    gcc versions.

    [TG3]: Fix SerDes detection
    
    A problem was reported by Grant Grundler on an HP rx8620 using IOX
    Core LAN partno(A7109-6) 5701 copper NIC. The tg3 driver mistakenly
    detects this NIC as having a SerDes PHY and link does not come up as a
    result.
    
    The problem was caused by an incorrectly programmed eeprom that set the
    NIC_SRAM_DATA_CFG_PHY_TYPE_FIBER bit in the NIC_SRAM_DATA_CFG location.
    
    This patch will override the NIC_SRAM_DATA_CFG_PHY_TYPE_FIBER bit if a
    valid PHY ID is read from the MII registers on older 570x chips where
    the MII interface is not used on SerDes chips. On newer chips such as
    the 5780 that use MII for both copper and SerDes, SerDes detection must
    rely on the eeprom.
    
    This patch will make the SerDes detection identical to versions 3.25 and
    older.

    [IA64] Simulator bootloader fails with gcc 4

    failed to read phdr
    
    After some investigation I believe this is do with differences between
    the alignment of variables on the stack between gcc 3 and 4 and the
    ski simulator.  If you trace through with the simulator you can see
    that the disk_stat structure value returned from the SSC_WAIT_COMPLETION
    call seems to be only half loaded.  I guess it doesn't like the alignment
    of the input.

    [PATCH] md: make sure mddev->bitmap_offset gets cleared between array instantiations.
    
    ... otherwise we might try to load a bitmap from an array which hasn't one.
    
    The bug is that if you create an array with an internal bitmap, shut it down,
    and then create an array with the same md device, the md drive will assume it
    should have a bitmap too.  As the array can be created with a different md
    device, it is mostly an inconvenience.  I'm pretty sure there is no risk of
    data corruption.

    [PATCH] NFS: Introduce the use of inode->i_lock to protect fields in nfsi
    
    Down the road we want to eliminate the use of the global kernel lock entirely
    from the NFS client.  To do this, we need to protect the fields in the
    nfs_inode structure adequately.  Start by serializing updates to the
    "cache_validity" field.
    
    Note this change addresses an SMP hang found by njw@osdl.org, where processes
    deadlock because nfs_end_data_update and nfs_revalidate_mapping update the
    "cache_validity" field without proper serialization.
    
    Test plan:
     Millions of fsx ops on SMP clients.  Run Nick Wilson's breaknfs program on
     large SMP clients.

    [PATCH] NFS: use atomic bitops to manipulate flags in nfsi->flags
    
    Introduce atomic bitops to manipulate the bits in the nfs_inode structure's
    "flags" field.
    
    Using bitops means we can use a generic wait_on_bit call instead of an ad hoc
    locking scheme in fs/nfs/inode.c, so we can remove the "nfs_i_wait" field from
    nfs_inode at the same time.
    
    The other new flags field will continue to use bitmask and logic AND and OR.
    This permits several flags to be set at the same time efficiently.  The
    following patch adds a spin lock to protect these flags, and this spin lock
    will later cover other fields in the nfs_inode structure, amortizing the cost
    of using this type of serialization.
    
    Test plan:
     Millions of fsx ops on SMP clients.

    [PATCH] nfsd to unlock kernel before exiting
    
    The nfsd holds the big kernel lock upon exit, when it really shouldn't.
    Not to mention that this breaks Ingo's RT patch. This is a trivial fix
    to release the lock.
    
    Ingo, this patch also works with your kernel, and stops the problem with
    nfsd.
    
    Note, there's a "goto out;" where "out:" is right above svc_exit_thread.
    The point of the goto also holds the kernel_lock, so I don't see any
    problem here in releasing it.

    leaves the system pretty hosed and you have to reboot to recover.
    
    Not good for real-time priority-preemption applications like our
    telephony application, with 90+ real-time (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR)

    [TCP]: Fix bug #5070: kernel BUG at net/ipv4/tcp_output.c:864
    
    1) We send out a normal sized packet with TSO on to start off.
    2) ICMP is received indicating a smaller MTU.
    3) We send the current sk_send_head which needs to be fragmented
    since it was created before the ICMP event.  The first fragment
    is then sent out.
    
    At this point the remaining fragment is allocated by tcp_fragment.
    However, its size is padded to fit the L1 cache-line size therefore
    creating tail-room up to 124 bytes long.
    
    This fragment will also be sitting at sk_send_head.
    
    4) tcp_sendmsg is called again and it stores data in the tail-room of
    of the fragment.
    5) tcp_push_one is called by tcp_sendmsg which then calls tso_fragment
    since the packet as a whole exceeds the MTU.
    
    At this point we have a packet that has data in the head area being
    fed to tso_fragment which bombs out.
    
    My take on this is that we shouldn't ever call tcp_fragment on a TSO
    socket for a packet that is yet to be transmitted since this creates
    a packet on sk_send_head that cannot be extended.
    
    So here is a patch to change it so that tso_fragment is always used
    in this case.

    [ARM] 2850/1: Remove duplicate UART I/O mapping from s3c2410_iodesc
    
    Patch from Dimitry Andric
    
    This patch removes the initial UART I/O mapping from s3c2410_iodesc,
    since the same mapping is already done in the function s3c24xx_init_io
    in the file arch/arm/mach-s3c2410/cpu.c, through the s3c_iodesc array.
    I'm not sure if duplicate mappings do any harm, but it's simply
    redundant.  Also, in s3c2440.c the UART I/O mapping is NOT done.
    Additionally, I put a comma behind the last mapping, to ease
    copy/pasting stuff around, and make the style consistent with
    s3c2440.c and other files.

    [PATCH] iSeries build with newer assemblers and compilers
    
    Paulus suggested that we put xLparMap in its own .c file so that we can
    generate a .s file to be included into head.S.  This doesn't get around
    the problem of having it at a fixed address, but it makes it more
    palatable.
    
    It would be good if this could be included in 2.6.13 as it solves our
    build problems with various versions of binutils and gcc.  In
    particular, it allows us to build an iSeries kernel on Debian unstable
    using their biarch compiler.
    
    This has been built and booted on iSeries and built for pSeries and g5.

    [TCP]: Fix bug #5070: kernel BUG at net/ipv4/tcp_output.c:864
    
    1) We send out a normal sized packet with TSO on to start off.
    2) ICMP is received indicating a smaller MTU.
    3) We send the current sk_send_head which needs to be fragmented
    since it was created before the ICMP event.  The first fragment
    is then sent out.
    
    At this point the remaining fragment is allocated by tcp_fragment.
    However, its size is padded to fit the L1 cache-line size therefore
    creating tail-room up to 124 bytes long.
    
    This fragment will also be sitting at sk_send_head.
    
    4) tcp_sendmsg is called again and it stores data in the tail-room of
    of the fragment.
    5) tcp_push_one is called by tcp_sendmsg which then calls tso_fragment
    since the packet as a whole exceeds the MTU.
    
    At this point we have a packet that has data in the head area being
    fed to tso_fragment which bombs out.
    
    My take on this is that we shouldn't ever call tcp_fragment on a TSO
    socket for a packet that is yet to be transmitted since this creates
    a packet on sk_send_head that cannot be extended.
    
    So here is a patch to change it so that tso_fragment is always used
    in this case.

    [PATCH] NFS: Ensure we always update inode->i_mode when doing O_EXCL creates
    
    When the client performs an exclusive create and opens the file for writing,
    a Netapp filer will first create the file using the mode 01777. It does this
    since an NFSv3/v4 exclusive create cannot immediately set the mode bits.
    The 01777 mode then gets put into the inode->i_mode. After the file creation
    is successful, we then do a setattr to change the mode to the correct value
    (as per the NFS spec).
    
    The problem is that nfs_refresh_inode() no longer updates inode->i_mode, so
    the latter retains the 01777 mode. A bit later, the VFS notices this, and calls
    remove_suid(). This of course now resets the file mode to inode->i_mode & 0777.
    Hey presto, the file mode on the server is now magically changed to 0777. Duh...

    [PATCH] intelfb/fbdev: Save info->flags in a local variable
    
    Reported by: Pavel Kysilka (Bugzilla Bug 5059)
    
    The intelfb driver does not keep resolution set with fbset after
    switching to anot console and back.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    
      initial options: tty1,tty2 - 1024x768-60
      1) tty1 - fbset after booting (1024x768-60)
      2) tty1 - fbset 800x600-100
      tty1: 800x600-100
      3) swith to tty2, swith to tty1
      tty1: 1024x768-60 (the same resolution as default from kernel booting)
    
    This bug is caused by intelfb unintentionally destroying info->flags in
    set_par(). Therefore the flag, FBINFO_MISC_USEREVENT used to notify
    fbcon of a mode change was cleared causing the above problem. This bug
    though is not intelfb specific, as other drivers may also be affected.
    
    The fix is to save info->flags in a local variable before calling any
    of the driver hooks.  A more definitive fix (for post 2.6.13) is to
    separate info->flags into one that is set by the driver and another that
    is set by core fbdev/fbcon.

    something like this:
    
     - app1:
    	watch /etc/mtab
    
     - app2:
    	cp /etc/mtab /tmp/mtab-work
    	mv /etc/mtab /etc/mtab~
    	mv /tmp/mtab-work /etc/mtab
    
    app1 still thinks it's watching /etc/mtab but it's actually watching
    /etc/mtab~.

    [TCP]: Adjust {p,f}ackets_out correctly in tcp_retransmit_skb()
    
    Well I've only found one potential cause for the assertion
    failure in tcp_mark_head_lost.  First of all, this can only
    occur if cnt > 1 since tp->packets_out is never zero here.
    If it did hit zero we'd have much bigger problems.
    
    So cnt is equal to fackets_out - reordering.  Normally
    fackets_out is less than packets_out.  The only reason
    I've found that might cause fackets_out to exceed packets_out
    is if tcp_fragment is called from tcp_retransmit_skb with a
    TSO skb and the current MSS is greater than the MSS stored
    in the TSO skb.  This might occur as the result of an expiring
    dst entry.
    
    In that case, packets_out may decrease (line 1380-1381 in
    tcp_output.c).  However, fackets_out is unchanged which means
    that it may in fact exceed packets_out.
    
    Previously tcp_retrans_try_collapse was the only place where
    packets_out can go down and it takes care of this by decrementing
    fackets_out.
    
    So we should make sure that fackets_out is reduced by an appropriate
    amount here as well.

    [PATCH] ns558 list handling fix
    
    Need to use list_for_entry_safe(), as we're removing items during the
    traversal.  list_for_each_entry() uses the first ptr also as an iterator, if
    you kfree() it slab takes it, might poison it and then you try to use it to
    iterate to the next object in list.

     sata_sx4 directly references sg->length to calculate total_len in

    merged multiple sg's into one and, in such case, sg->length doesn't

    [NET]: Fix memory leak in sys_{send,recv}msg() w/compat
    
    From: Dave Johnson <djohnson+linux-kernel@sw.starentnetworks.com>
    
    sendmsg()/recvmsg() syscalls from o32/n32 apps to a 64bit kernel will
    cause a kernel memory leak if iov_len > UIO_FASTIOV for each syscall!
    
    This is because both sys_sendmsg() and verify_compat_iovec() kmalloc a
    new iovec structure.  Only the one from sys_sendmsg() is free'ed.
    
    I wrote a simple test program to confirm this after identifying the
    problem:
    
    http://davej.org/programs/testsendmsg.c
    
    Note that the below fix will break solaris_sendmsg()/solaris_recvmsg() as
    it also calls verify_compat_iovec() but expects it to malloc internally.
    
    [ I fixed that. -DaveM ]

    Remove new configuration API from i2o_config
    
    The API-patch is still available from the I2O website (which is mentioned in

    Adaptec controllers, which has a limitation in the hardware this attribute
    doesn't make sense anywhere else.  Until the sysfs API provides an attribute
    which doesn't buffer (like firmware) and let access to at least 64k blocks i
    provide a separate patch...

    it out before 2.6.13).

    [PATCH] cpuset release ABBA deadlock fix
    
    Fix possible cpuset_sem ABBA deadlock if 'notify_on_release' set.
    
    For a particular usage pattern, creating and destroying cpusets fairly
    frequently using notify_on_release, on a very large system, this deadlock
    can be seen every few days.  If you are not using the cpuset
    notify_on_release feature, you will never see this deadlock.
    
    The existing code, on task exit (or cpuset deletion) did:
    
      get cpuset_sem
      if cpuset marked notify_on_release and is ready to release:
        compute cpuset path relative to /dev/cpuset mount point
        call_usermodehelper() forks /sbin/cpuset_release_agent with path
      drop cpuset_sem
    
    Unfortunately, the fork in call_usermodehelper can allocate memory, and
    allocating memory can require cpuset_sem, if the mems_generation values
    changed in the interim.  This results in an ABBA deadlock, trying to obtain
    cpuset_sem when it is already held by the current task.
    
    To fix this, I put the cpuset path (which must be computed while holding
    cpuset_sem) in a temporary buffer, to be used in the call_usermodehelper
    call of /sbin/cpuset_release_agent only _after_ dropping cpuset_sem.
    
    So the new logic is:
    
      get cpuset_sem
      if cpuset marked notify_on_release and is ready to release:
        compute cpuset path relative to /dev/cpuset mount point
        stash path in kmalloc'd buffer
      drop cpuset_sem
      call_usermodehelper() forks /sbin/cpuset_release_agent with path
      free path
    
    The sharp eyed reader might notice that this patch does not contain any
    calls to kmalloc.  The existing code in the check_for_release() routine was
    already kmalloc'ing a buffer to hold the cpuset path.  In the old code, it
    just held the buffer for a few lines, over the cpuset_release_agent() call
    that in turn invoked call_usermodehelper().  In the new code, with the
    application of this patch, it returns that buffer via the new char
    **ppathbuf parameter, for later use and freeing in cpuset_release_agent(),
    which is called after cpuset_sem is dropped.  Whereas the old code has just
    one call to cpuset_release_agent(), right in the check_for_release()
    routine, the new code has three calls to cpuset_release_agent(), from the
    various places that a cpuset can be released.
    
    This patch has been build and booted on SN2, and passed a stress test that
    previously hit the deadlock within a few seconds.

    default_idle() is looking at new variable can_do_pal_halt.  However,
    that variable did not get cleared upon "nohalt" boot option.  Result
    is that "nohalt" option is ignored until perfmon is exercised.

    [SCSI] fix target scanning oops with fc transport class
    
    We have some nasty issues with 2.6.12-rc6. Any request to scan on
    the lpfc or qla2xxx FC adapters will oops. What is happening is the
    system is defaulting to non-transport registered targets, which
    inherit the parent of the scan. On this second scan, performed by
    the attribute, the parent becomes the shost instead of the rport.
    The slave functions in the 2 FC adapters use starget_to_rport()
    routines, which incorrectly map the shost as an rport pointer.
    
    Additionally, this pointed out other weaknesses:
    - If the target structure is torn down outside of the transport,
      we have no method for it to be regenerated at the proper parent.
    - We have race conditions on the target being allocated by both
      the midlayer scan (parent=shost) and by the fc transport
      (parent=rport).

    [PATCH] fsnotify_name/inoderemove
    
    The patch below unhooks fsnotify from vfs_unlink & vfs_rmdir.  It
    introduces two new fsnotify calls, that are hooked in at the dcache
    level.  This not only more closely matches how the VFS layer works, it
    also avoids the problem with locking and inode lifetimes.
    
    The two functions are
    
     - fsnotify_nameremove -- called when a directory entry is going away.
       It notifies the PARENT of the deletion.  This is called from
       d_delete().
    
     - inoderemove -- called when the files inode itself is going away.  It
       notifies the inode that is being deleted.  This is called from
       dentry_iput().

    [PATCH] don't try to do any NAT on untracked connections
    
    With the introduction of 'rustynat' in 2.6.11, the old tricks of preventing
    NAT of 'untracked' connections (e.g. NOTRACK target in 'raw' table) are no
    longer sufficient.
    
    The ip_conntrack_untracked.status |= IPS_NAT_DONE_MASK effectively
    prevents iteration of the 'nat' table, but doesn't prevent nat_packet()
    to be executed.  Since nr_manips is gone in 'rustynat', nat_packet() now
    implicitly thinks that it has to do NAT on the packet.
    
    This patch fixes that problem by explicitly checking for
    ip_conntrack_untracked in ip_nat_fn().

    [PATCH] nvidiafb: Fix initial display corruption on certain laptops
    
    Reported by:Vincent Fortier (Bugzilla Bug 4768)
    
    "At boot time the screen appears moved to the mid right portion of the actual
    video pannel making the end of the line appears at the left edge...  It simply
    looks like moved half way to the right"
    
    His particular hardware has a display with an unusual dimension (1920x1200) but
    unfortunately has no EDID block. None of the entries in the global mode
    database is correct for this particular display, and it particularly has
    difficulty scaling up 640x480 (the default startup mode of nvidiafb) to
    1920x1200 which causes the above described problem.
    
    1, Add 1920x1200 to the global mode database.
    
    2. Let nvidiafb base the startup mode from the flatpanel dimensions only if the
      EDID block is absent, no boot mode parameter is specified by the user, and
      a flatpanel/LCD display is attached.

    [PATCH] namespace.c: fix bind mount from foreign namespace
    
    I'm resending this patch, because I still believe it's the correct fix.
    
    Tested before/after applying the patch with a test application
    available from:
    
      http://www.inf.bme.hu/~mszeredi/nstest.c
    
    Bind mount from a foreign namespace results in an un-removable mount.
    The reason is that mnt->mnt_namespace is copied from the old mount in
    clone_mnt().  Because of this check_mnt() in sys_umount() will fail.
    
    The solution is to set mnt->mnt_namespace to current->namespace in
    clone_mnt().  clone_mnt() is either called from do_loopback() or
    copy_tree().  copy_tree() is called from do_loopback() or
    copy_namespace().
    
    When called (directly or indirectly) from do_loopback(), always
    current->namspace is being modified: check_mnt(nd->mnt).  So setting
    mnt->mnt_namespace to current->namspace is the right thing to do.
    
    When called from copy_namespace(), the setting of mnt_namespace is
    irrelevant, since mnt_namespace is reset later in that function for
    all copied mounts.
    
    Jamie said:
    
      This patch is correct.  The old code was buggy for more fundamental and
      serious reason: it broke the invariant that a tree of vfsmnts all have the
      same value of mnt_namespace (and the same for the mnt_list list).

    [PATCH] Fix restore of 64-bit PCI BAR's
    
    For 64-bit BAR[i] only pci_dev->resource[i] is valid, ->resource[i+1]
    slot is unused and contains zeroes in all fields.
    
    So when we update a PCI BAR, all we need is just to check that we're
    going to update a _valid_ resource.
    
    Also make sure to write high bits - use "x >> 16 >> 16" (rather than the
    simpler ">> 32") to avoid warnings on 32-bit architectures where we're
    not going to have any high bits.

    [PATCH] blk: fix tag shrinking (revive real_max_size)
    
    My patch in commit fa72b903f75e4f0f0b2c2feed093005167da4023 incorrectly
    removed blk_queue_tag->real_max_depth.
    
    The original resize implementation was incorrect in the following
    points.
    
     * actual allocation size of tag_index was shorter than real_max_size,
       but assumed to be of the same size, possibly causing memory access
       beyond the allocated area.
     * bits in tag_map between max_deptn and real_max_depth were
       initialized to 1's, making the tags permanently reserved.
    
    In an attempt to fix above two bugs, I had removed allocation optimization
    in init_tag_map and real_max_size.  Tag map/index were allocated and freed
    immediately during resize.
    
    Unfortunately, I wasn't considering that tag map/index can be resized
    dynamically with tags beyond new_depth active.  This led to accessing
    freed area after shrinking tags and led to the following bug reporting
    thread on linux-scsi.
    
       http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=112319898111885&w=2
    
    To fix the problem, I've revived real_max_depth without allocation
    optimization in init_tag_map, and Andrew Vasquez confirmed that the
    problem was fixed.  As Jens is not going to be available for a week, he
    asked me to make sure that this patch reaches you.
    
       http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=112325778530886&w=2
    
    Also, a comment was added to make sure that real_max_size is needed for
    dynamic shrinking.

    assuming that (due to prefault) PTEs must exist for all the area in
    question.  However, this may not be the case, if mmap() encounters an error
    before the prefault and calls unmap_region() to clean up any partial
    mapping.
    
    Depending on the hugepage configuration, this crash can be triggered by an
    unpriveleged user.

    [PATCH] tpm_infineon: Support for new TPM 1.2 and PNPACPI
    
    This patch includes support for the new Infineon Trusted Platform Module
    SLB 9635 TT 1.2 and does further include ACPI-support for both chip
    versions (SLD 9630 TT 1.1 and SLB9635 TT 1.2).  Since the ioports and
    configuration registers are not correctly set on some machines, the
    configuration is now done via PNPACPI, which reads out the correct values
    out of the DSDT-table.  Note that you have to have CONFIG_PNP,
    CONFIG_ACPI_BUS and CONFIG_PNPACPI enabled to run this driver (assuming
    that mainboards including a TPM do have the need for ACPI anyway).

    [PATCH] rtc: msleep() cannot be used from interrupt
    
    Since the beginning of July my Opteron box was randomly crashing and
    being rebooted by hardware watchdog.  Today it finally did it in front
    of me, and this patch will hopefully fix it.
    
    The problem is that at the end of June (the 28th, to be exact: commit
    47f176fdaf8924bc83fddcf9658f2fd3ef60d573, "[PATCH] Using msleep()
    instead of HZ") rtc_get_rtc_time was converted to use msleep() instead
    of busy waiting.  But rtc_get_rtc_time is used by hpet_rtc_interrupt,
    and scheduling is not allowed during interrupt.  So I'm reverting this
    part of original change, replacing msleep() back with busy loop.
    
    The original code was busy waiting for up to 20ms, but on my hardware in
    the worst case update-in-progress bit was asserted for at most 363
    passes through loop (on 2GHz dual Opteron), much less than even one
    jiffie, not even talking about 20ms.  So I changed code to just wait
    only as long as necessary.  Otherwise when RTC was set to generate
    8192Hz timer, it stopped doing anything for 20ms (160 pulses were
    skipped!) from time to time, and this is rather suboptimal as far as I
    can tell.

    [PATCH] __vm_enough_memory() signedness fix
    
    We have found what seems to be a small bug in __vm_enough_memory() when
    sysctl_overcommit_memory is set to OVERCOMMIT_NEVER.
    
    When this bug occurs the systems fails to boot, with /sbin/init whining
    about fork() returning ENOMEM.
    
    We hunted down the problem to this:
    
    The deferred update mecanism used in vm_acct_memory(), on a SMP system,
    allows the vm_committed_space counter to have a negative value.
    
    This should not be a problem since this counter is known to be inaccurate.
    
    But in __vm_enough_memory() this counter is compared to the `allowed'
    variable, which is an unsigned long.  This comparison is broken since it
    will consider the negative values of vm_committed_space to be huge positive
    values, resulting in a memory allocation failure.

    [PATCH] tcp: fix TSO sizing bugs
    
    MSS changes can be lost since we preemptively initialize the tso_segs count
    for an SKB before we %100 commit to sending it out.
    
    So, by the time we send it out, the tso_size information can be stale due
    to PMTU events.  This mucks up all of the logic in our send engine, and can
    even result in the BUG() triggering in tcp_tso_should_defer().
    
    Another problem we have is that we're storing the tp->mss_cache, not the
    SACK block normalized MSS, as the tso_size.  That's wrong too.

    [PATCH] USB: ehci: microframe handling fix
    
    This patch has a one line oops fix, plus related cleanups.
    
     - The bugfix uses microframe scheduling data given to the hardware to
       test "is this a periodic QH", rather than testing for nonzero period.
       (Prevents an oops by providing the correct answer.)
    
     - The cleanup going along with the patch should make it clearer what's
       going on whenever those bitfields are accessed.
    
    The bug came about when, around January, two new kinds of EHCI interrupt
    scheduling operation were added, involving both the high speed (24 KBytes
    per millisec) and low/full speed (1-64 bytes per millisec) microframe
    scheduling.  A driver for the Edirol UA-1000 Audio Capture Unit ran into
    the oops; it used one of the newly supported high speed modes.

    In yenta_socket, we default to using the resource setting of the CardBus

    pcibios_bus_to_resource() call in between.  This function is a mere wrapper on
    x86 and friends, however on some others it already exists, is added in this

    [PATCH] PCI: restore BAR values after D3hot->D0 for devices that need it
    
    Some PCI devices (e.g. 3c905B, 3c556B) lose all configuration
    (including BARs) when transitioning from D3hot->D0.  This leaves such
    a device in an inaccessible state.  The patch below causes the BARs
    to be restored when enabling such a device, so that its driver will
    be able to access it.
    
    The patch also adds pci_restore_bars as a new global symbol, and adds a
    correpsonding EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for that.
    
    Some firmware (e.g. Thinkpad T21) leaves devices in D3hot after a
    (re)boot.  Most drivers call pci_enable_device very early, so devices
    left in D3hot that lose configuration during the D3hot->D0 transition
    will be inaccessible to their drivers.
    
    Drivers could be modified to account for this, but it would
    be difficult to know which drivers need modification.  This is
    especially true since often many devices are covered by the same
    driver.  It likely would be necessary to replicate code across dozens
    of drivers.
    
    The patch below should trigger only when transitioning from D3hot->D0
    (or at boot), and only for devices that have the "no soft reset" bit
    cleared in the PM control register.  I believe it is safe to include
    this patch as part of the PCI infrastructure.
    
    The cleanest implementation of pci_restore_bars was to call
    pci_update_resource.  Unfortunately, that does not currently exist
    for the sparc64 architecture.  The patch below includes a null
    implemenation of pci_update_resource for sparc64.
    
    Some have expressed interest in making general use of the the
    pci_restore_bars function, so that has been exported to GPL licensed
    modules.

    [PATCH] Destruction of failed keyring oopses
    
    The attached patch makes sure that a keyring that failed to instantiate
    properly is destroyed without oopsing [CAN-2005-2099].
    
    The problem occurs in three stages:
    
     (1) The key allocator initialises the type-specific data to all zeroes. In
         the case of a keyring, this will become a link in the keyring name list
         when the keyring is instantiated.
    
     (2) If a user (any user) attempts to add a keyring with anything other than
         an empty payload, the keyring instantiation function will fail with an
         error and won't add the keyring to the name list.
    
     (3) The keyring's destructor then sees that the keyring has a description
         (name) and tries to remove the keyring from the name list, which oopses
         because the link pointers are both zero.
    
    This bug permits any user to take down a box trivially.

    [PATCH] Error during attempt to join key management session can leave semaphore pinned
    
    The attached patch prevents an error during the key session joining operation
    from hanging future joins in the D state [CAN-2005-2098].
    
    The problem is that the error handling path for the KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING
    operation has one error path that doesn't release the session management
    semaphore. Further attempts to get the semaphore will then sleep for ever in
    the D state.
    
    This can happen in four situations, all involving an attempt to allocate a new
    session keyring:
    
     (1) ENOMEM.
    
     (2) The users key quota being reached.
    
     (3) A keyring name that is an empty string.
    
     (4) A keyring name that is too long.
    
    Any user may attempt this operation, and so any user can cause the problem to
    occur.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix for kexec boot issue
    
    The kexec boot is not successful on some power machines since all CPUs are
    getting removed from global interrupt queue (GIQ) before kexec boot.  Some
    systems always expect at least one CPU in GIQ.  Hence, this patch will make
    sure that only secondary CPUs are removed from GIQ.

    The recent change to never ignore the bitmap, revealed that the bitmap isn't

    [PATCH] md: yet another attempt to get bitmap-based resync to do the right thing in all cases...
    
    Firstly, R1BIO_Degraded was being set in a number of places in the resync
    code, but is never used there, so get rid of those settings.
    
    Then: When doing a resync, we want to clear the bit in the bitmap iff the
    array will be non-degraded when the sync has completed.  However the current
    code would clear the bitmap if the array was non-degraded when the resync
    *started*, which obviously isn't right (it is for 'resync' but not for
    'recovery' - i.e.  rebuilding a failed drive).
    
    This patch calculated 'still_degraded' and uses the to tell bitmap_start_sync
    whether this sync should clear the corresponding bit.

    [PATCH] md: always honour md bitmap being read from disk
    
    The code currently will ignore the bitmap if the array seem to be in-sync.
    This is wrong if the array is degraded, and probably wrong anyway.  If the
    bitmap says some chunks are not in in-sync, and the superblock says everything
    IS in sync, then something is clearly wrong, and it is safer to trust the
    bitmap.

    1) If pci_quicks does identify the chip as having troubles to
       handle PCI2PCI transfers, no_overlay defaults to 1. The user may force
       it to 0, to reenable (not recommended).
    
    2) For newer chipsets not blacklisted, no_overlay=1 is provided as a
       workaround until PCI chipset included on /drivers/pci/quirks.c

    [SCSI] fix aic7xxx performance issues since 2.6.12-rc2
    
    Several people noticed we dropped quite a bit on benchmark figures.
    OK, it was my fault but unfortunately I discovered I ran out of brown
    paper bags a while ago and forgot to reorder them.
    
    The issue is that a construct introduced in the conversion of the
    driver to use the transport class keyed off whether the block request
    was tagged or not.  However, the aic7xxx driver doesn't properly set
    up the block layer TCQ (it uses the wrong API), so the driver now
    things all requests are untagged and we keep it to a queue depth of a
    single element.  Oops.
    
    The fix is to use the correct TCQ API.

    [PATCH] Keys: Fix key management syscall interface bugs
    
    This fixes five bugs in the key management syscall interface:
    
     (1) add_key() returns 0 rather than EINVAL if the key type is "".
    
         Checking the key type isn't "" should be left to lookup_user_key().
    
     (2) request_key() returns ENOKEY rather than EPERM if the key type begins
         with a ".".
    
         lookup_user_key() can't do this because internal key types begin with a
         ".".
    
     (3) Key revocation always returns 0, even if it fails.
    
     (4) Key read can return EAGAIN rather than EACCES under some circumstances.
    
         A key is permitted to by read by a process if it doesn't grant read
         access, but it does grant search access and it is in the process's
         keyrings. That search returns EAGAIN if it fails, and this needs
         translating to EACCES.
    
     (5) request_key() never adds the new key to the destination keyring if one is
         supplied.
    
         The wrong macro was being used to test for an error condition: PTR_ERR()
         will always return true, whether or not there's an error; this should've
         been IS_ERR().

    [PATCH] Remove suspend() calls from shutdown path
    
    This removes the calls to device_suspend() from the shutdown path that
    were added sometime during 2.6.13-rc*.  They aren't working properly on
    a number of configs (I got reports from both ppc powerbook users and x86
    users) causing the system to not shutdown anymore.
    
    I think it isn't the right approach at the moment anyway.  We have
    already a shutdown() callback for the drivers that actually care about
    shutdown and the suspend() code isn't yet in a good enough shape to be
    so much generalized.  Also, the semantics of suspend and shutdown are
    slightly different on a number of setups and the way this was patched in
    provides little way for drivers to cleanly differenciate.  It should
    have been at least a different message.
    
    For 2.6.13, I think we should revert to 2.6.12 behaviour and have a
    working suspend back.

    [PATCH] ARM: 2833/2:  Remove support for WDIOF_MAGICCLOSE from sa1100-wdt
    
    Patch from Ian Campbell
    
    On PXA255 there is no way to disable the watchdog. Turning off OIER[E3]
    as suggested in the existing comment does not work.
    
    I posted a note to the ARM mailing list a little while ago asking for
    opinions from people using SA1100. There was one reponse from Nico who
    believes that the SA1100 is the same as the PXA255 in this respect.
    
    You also asked me to involve the watchdog maintainer which I tried to
    do but didn't hear anything back. There are only a couple of other
    drivers which can't stop the watchdog and there seems to be no
    consistancy regarding printing an error etc. I decided to print

    [PATCH] fix get_user_pages bug
    
    Checking pte_dirty instead of pte_write in __follow_page is problematic
    for s390, and for copy_one_pte which leaves dirty when clearing write.
    
    So revert __follow_page to check pte_write as before, and make
    do_wp_page pass back a special extra VM_FAULT_WRITE bit to say it has
    done its full job: once get_user_pages receives this value, it no longer
    requires pte_write in __follow_page.
    
    But most callers of handle_mm_fault, in the various architectures, have
    switch statements which do not expect this new case.  To avoid changing
    them all in a hurry, make an inline wrapper function (using the old
    name) that masks off the new bit, and use the extended interface with
    double underscores.
    
    Yes, we do have a call to do_wp_page from do_swap_page, but no need to
    change that: in rare case it's needed, another do_wp_page will follow.

    For soft reset during system hang, got an error "CPU did not take

    SystemReset, die and called debugger - xmon).   First these CPUs entered
    into xmon by IPI callback and then got a soft-reset exception and
    re-entered into xmon again. The first CPU which re-entered into xmon got
    the output lock and made into xmon successfully without unlocking.
    Hence, the next CPU(s) which re-entered into xmon try to acquire a lock
    (get_output_lock). Therefore, we can not view state of those CPU(s).

    [PATCH] increase PCIBIOS_MIN_IO on x86
    
    There is a number of x86 laptops that have some non-PCI IO ports
    in the 0x1000-0x1fff range, and it's quite hard to control the correct
    order of resource allocation between PCI and other subsystems controlling
    these ports. Especially with modular kernel.
    
    So just increase PCIBIOS_MIN_IO to 0x4000 to prevent any new PCI
    resource allocations in the problematic range (this limitation must
    apply _only_ to the root bus resources - see Linus' change in
    pci_bus_alloc_resource).  As PCIBIOS_MIN_IO and PCIBIOS_MIN_CARDBUS_IO
    are the same now on i386 and x86-64, we can remove the latter.

    pci: make bus resource start address override minimum IO address
    
    The reason we have PCIBIOS_MIN_IO and PCIBIOS_MIN_CARDBUS_IO is because
    we want to protect badly documented motherboard PCI resources and thus
    don't want to allocate new resources in low IO/MEM space.
    
    However, if we have already discovered a PCI bridge with a specified
    resource base, that should override that decision.
    
    This change will allow us to move the "careful" region upwards without
    resulting in problems allocating resources in low mappings.  This was
    brought on by us having allocated a bus resource at 0x1000, conflicting
    with a undocumented VAIO Sony PI resources.

    [PATCH] Obvious bugfix for yenta resource allocation
    
    Recent changes (well, dating from 12 July) have broken cardbus on my
    powerbook: I get 3 messages saying "no resource of type xxx available,
    trying to continue", and if I plug in my wireless card, it complains
    that there are no resources allocated to the card.  This all worked in
    2.6.12.
    
    Looking at the code in yenta_socket.c, function yenta_allocate_res,
    it's obvious what is wrong: if we get to line 639 (i.e. there wasn't a
    usable preassigned resource), we will always flow through to line 668,
    which is the printk that I was seeing, even if a resource was
    successfully allocated.  It looks to me as though there should be a
    return statement after the two config_writel's in each of the 3
    branches of the if statements, so that the function returns after
    successfully setting up the resource.
    
    The patch below adds these return statements, and with this patch,
    cardbus works on my powerbook once again.

    [PATCH] ppc64: POWER 4 fails to boot with NUMA
    
    If CONFIG_NUMA is set, some POWER 4 systems will fail to boot.  This is
    because of special processing needed to handle invalid node IDs (0xffff) on
    POWER 4.  My previous patch to handle memory 'holes' within nodes forgot to
    add this special case for POWER 4 in one place.
    
    In reality, I'm not sure that configuring the kernel for NUMA on POWER 4 makes
    much sense.  Are there POWER 4 based systems with NUMA characteristics that
    are presented by the firmware?  But, distros want one kernel for all systems
    so NUMA is on by default in their kernels.  The patch handles those cases.

    [PATCH] m32r: Fix local-timer event handling
    
    There was a scheduling problem of the m32r SMP kernel; A process rarely
    stopped and gave no responding but the other process have been handled by
    the other CPU still lives, then if we did something in the other terminal
    or something like that, the stopped process came back to life and continued
    its operation...  (ex.  LMbench: lat_sig)
    
    In the m32r SMP kernel, a local-timer event is delivered by using an
    IPI(inter processor interrupts); LOCAL_TIMER_IPI.  And a function
    smp_send_timer() is prepared to send the LOCAL_TIMER_IPI from the current
    CPU to the other CPUs.
    
    The funtion smp_send_timer() was placed and used in do_IRQ() in
    former times (before 2.6.10-rc3-mm1 kernel), however, it was
    unintentionally removed when arch/m32r/kernel/irq.c was modified to
    employ the generic hardirq framework (CONFIG_GENERIC_HARDIRQ) in
    my previous patch.

    [PATCH] V4L: Miscellaneous fixes
    
    - Fixed some bttv card numbers.
    
    - BTTV and SAA7134 version numbers incremented to reflect changes.
    
    - pci_dma_supported() is called after pci_set_dma_mask() which
      already did check that for us. This patch removes the unneeded call to
      pci_dma_supported() at bttv-driver.c
    
    - Ensure a sufficient I2C bus idle time between 2 messages for
      saa7134-i2c.c
    
    - It is important to write at first to MO_GP3_IO for cx88-tvaudio.c
    
    - Use try_to_freeze() instead of refrigerator at msp3400.c
    
    - Recognizing the MFPE05-2 Tuner at tveeprom.c
    
    - Add new parameter to help identify radio chipsets at tuner module:
      show_i2c=1 will show 16 reading bytes from detected tuners.
    
    - BTTV does generate some Unimplemented IOCTL log at tuner module:
      0x40046d11(dir=1,tp=0x6d,nr=17,sz=4) means that it is sending
      MSP3400 calls to non-msp3400 tuners. Warning eliminated.
      VIDIOSAUDIO is also called, so debug messages updated. It is still
      requiring IOCTL implementation.
    
    - Added two more tuners.
    
    - Add support for the SVideo input on the GDI Black Gold.

    [PATCH] disable addres space randomization default on transmeta CPUs
    
    We know that the randomisation slows down some workloads on Transmeta CPUs
    by quite large amounts.  We think it's because the CPU needs to recode the
    same x86 instructions when they pop up at a different virtual address after
    a fork+exec.

    Fix get_user_pages() race for write access
    
    There's no real guarantee that handle_mm_fault() will always be able to
    break a COW situation - if an update from another thread ends up
    modifying the page table some way, handle_mm_fault() may end up
    requiring us to re-try the operation.
    
    That's normally fine, but get_user_pages() ended up re-trying it as a
    read, and thus a write access could in theory end up losing the dirty
    bit or be done on a page that had not been properly COW'ed.
    
    This makes get_user_pages() always retry write accesses as write
    accesses by making "follow_page()" require that a writable follow has
    the dirty bit set.  That simplifies the code and solves the race: if the
    COW break fails for some reason, we'll just loop around and try again.

    [PATCH] tridentfb: Fix scrolling artifacts during disk IO
    
    Reported by: Jochen Hein (Bugzilla Bug 4312)
    
    When there is disk I/O happening, the framebuffer has a little snow on
    the screen.  Once I/O has finished, no garbage remains on screen.
    
    This bug was explained by: Knut Petersen
    
    Most important is CRTC register 2f, signal quality is also improved for
    higher vclk values by changing set_vclk() according to the X drivers and
    cyblafb.c
    
    The fix is to set the performance register (0x2f) with a more stable
    value.

    [PATCH] tridentfb: Fix scrolling artifacts if acceleration is enabled
    
    Reported by: Jochen Hein (Bugzilla Bug 4386)
    
    booting leaves the end of long lines in the last line on screen when
    scrolling.  When X is running, scrolling puts garbage on the screen
    (looks like X data) Console switch fixes the screen.  Behaviour seems to
    be identical with noaccel and without on the video=tridentfb parameter
    in lilo.conf.
    
    This bug was explained by: Knut_Petersen
    
    Acceleration is broken for all BLADE 3D chips for all versions of kernel
    2.6 except for 32bit modes.  Most important reason is that the u32 col
    parameter of the graphics engine needs the color value replicated to all
    u8 of the u32 (8bit modes) and to both u16 of the u32.
    
    Fix color value passed to graphics engine, verified by the reporter.

    hit v2.6.13 in its current form.
    
    Firstly, the syscall lacks basic syscall design: e.g. it allows the
    global setting of VM policy for unprivileged users. (!) [ Imagine an
    Oracle installation and a SAP installation on the same NUMA box fighting
    over the 'optimal' setting for this flag. What will they do? Will they
    try to set the flag to their own preferred value every second or so? ]
    
    Secondly, it was added based on a single datapoint from Martin:
    
     http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm&m=111763597218177&w=2
    
    where Martin characterizes the numbers the following way:
    
     ' Run-to-run variability for "make -j" is huge, so these numbers aren't
       terribly useful except to see that with reclaim the benchmark still
       finishes in a reasonable amount of time. '
    
    in other words: the fundamental problem has likely not been solved, only
    a tendential move into the right direction has been observed, and a
    handful of numbers were picked out of a set of hugely variable results,
    without showing the variability data. How much variance is there
    run-to-run?
    
    I'd really suggest to first walk the walk and see what's needed to get
    stable & predictable kernel compilation numbers on that NUMA box, before
    adding random syscalls to tune a particular aspect of the VM ... which
    approach might not even matter once the whole picture has been analyzed
    and understood!
    
    The third, most important point is that the syscall exposes VM tuning
    internals in a completely unstructured way. What sense does it make to
    have a _GLOBAL_ per-node setting for 'should we go to another node for
    reclaim'? If then it might make sense to do this per-app, via numalib or
    so.
    
    The change is minimalistic in that it doesnt remove the syscall and the
    underlying infrastructure changes, only the user-visible changes.  We
    could perhaps add a CAP_SYS_ADMIN-only sysctl for this hack, a'ka
    /proc/sys/vm/swappiness, but even that looks quite counterproductive
    when the generic approach is that we are trying to reduce the number of
    external factors in the VM balance picture.

    [PATCH] inotify: fix race between the kernel and user space
    
    When you rm a watch, an IN_IGNORED event is sent down the event queue
    with the watch descriptor that you just rm'd.
    
    If you then add a watch you could get the ignored watch's wd and if you
    haven't read the entire event queue, user space will think that it's
    newly created watch was just ignored.

    idr_get_new.

    [PATCH] SCSI_SATA has to be a tristate
    
    SCSI=m must disallow static drivers.
    
    The problem is that all the SATA drivers depend on SCSI_SATA.
    
    With SCSI=m and SCSI_SATA=y this allows the static enabling of the SATA
    drivers with unwanted effects, e.g.:
    - SCSI=m, SCSI_SATA=y, SCSI_ATA_ADMA=y
      -> SCSI_ATA_ADMA is built statically but scsi/built-in.o is not linked
         into the kernel
    - SCSI=m, SCSI_SATA=y, SCSI_ATA_ADMA=y, SCSI_SATA_AHCI=m
      -> SCSI_ATA_ADMA and libata are built statically but
         scsi/built-in.o is not linked into the kernel,
         SCSI_SATA_AHCI is built modular (unresolved symbols due to missing
                                          libata)

    [NET] Fix too aggressive backoff in dst garbage collection
    
    The bug is evident when it is seen once. dst gc timer was backed off,
    when gc queue is not empty. But this means that timer quickly backs off,
    if at least one destination remains in use. Normally, the bug is invisible,
    because adding new dst entry to queue cancels the backoff. But it shots
    deadly with destination cache overflow when new destinations are not released
    for long time f.e. after an interface goes down.
    
    The fix is to cancel backoff when something was released.

    [PATCH] x86_64: avoid wasting IRQs patch update
    
    The patch adds boundary check for the MAX_GSI_NUM.  Same as the update for
    i386, the patch addresses a problem with ACPI SCI IRQ.  The patch corrects
    the code such that SCI IRQ is skipped and duplicate entry is avoided.  The
    VIA chipset uses 4-bit IRQ register for internal interrupt routing, and
    therefore cannot handle IRQ numbers assigned to its devices.  The patch
    corrects this problem by allowing PCI IRQs below 16.

    I was observing reproducible crashes on the "movw %bx,(%rsi)" instruction
    below while a process in a recvfrom() system call was copying packet data
    to user space.  The patch below fixes the exception table and causes the
    crash to no longer reproduce.  Please apply.

    [PATCH] ppc32: fix 44x early serial debug for configurations with more than 512M of RAM
    
    Fix 44x early serial debugging for big RAM configurations (more than 512M).
     We cannot use default OpenBIOS virtual mapping, because it interferes with
    pinned TLB entry.
    
    While we are at it, move early UART mapping to TLB slot 0, so it can
    survive longer during boot process (slot 1 is used by the first ioremap
    call, effectively killing UART mapping if it occupies this slot).  Also,
    change UART TLB entry size to 4K (256M is too much for a bunch of registers
    :).  Squash some warnings on the way.
    
    Tested on Ebony and Ocotea with 1G of RAM.

    [PATCH] Fix NUMA node sizing in nr_free_zone_pages
    
    We are iterating over all nodes in nr_free_zone_pages().  Because the
    fallback zonelists contain all nodes in the system, and we walk all the
    zonelists, we're counting memory multiple times (once for each node).  This
    caused us to make a size estimate of 32GB for an 8GB AMD64 box, which makes
    all the dirty ratio calculations, etc incorrect.
    
    There's still a further bug to fix from e820 holes causing overestimation
    as well, but this fix is separate, and good as is, and fixes one class of
    problems.  Problem found by Badari, and tested by Ram Pai - thanks!

    [PATCH] agp: restore APBASE after setting APSIZE
    
    When leaving S3 state, the AGP bridge may not have all PCI configuration
    registers set in the same way as they were at boot.  This should be fixed
    by pci_restore_state - however, the APBASE register cannot be set to
    conflict with the APSIZE register.  If APSIZE is larger than it was before
    suspend, pci_restore_state will not restore APBASE correctly.  The attached
    patch adds an extra item to the agp_bridge_data structure and uses it to
    store the value of APBASE.  On resume, this is then written after APSIZE
    has been set.  This patch only touches the path used for Intel chipsets
    without integrated graphics, and may need to be extended to work with the
    others.
    
    Without this patch, I get the symptoms described in bug 4921 - APBASE ends
    up overlapping various PCI devices, and as a result they fail to work after
    resume.

    [PATCH] x86: avoid wasting IRQs patch update
    
    The patch addresses a problem with ACPI SCI interrupt entry, which gets
    re-used, and the IRQ is assigned to another unrelated device.  The patch
    corrects the code such that SCI IRQ is skipped and duplicate entry is
    avoided.  Second issue came up with VIA chipset, the problem was caused by
    original patch assigning IRQs starting 16 and up.  The VIA chipset uses
    4-bit IRQ register for internal interrupt routing, and therefore cannot
    handle IRQ numbers assigned to its devices.  The patch corrects this
    problem by allowing PCI IRQs below 16.

    This is a bug, vesafb attempts to add a size < PAGE_SIZE triggering

    To eliminate the warning messages, you can add the option mtrr:2 to add a

    1. Fix algorithm for finding the best power of 2 size with mtrr_add().

       mtrr:n where n
    
            0 = no mtrr (equivalent to using the nomtrr option)

    [PATCH] Fix sync_tsc hang
    
    sync_tsc was using smp_call_function to ask the boot processor to report
    it's tsc value.  smp_call_function performs an IPI_send_allbutself which is
    a broadcast ipi.  There is a window during processor startup during which
    the target cpu has started and before it has initialized it's interrupt
    vectors so it can properly process an interrupt.  Receveing an interrupt
    during that window will triple fault the cpu and do other nasty things.
    
    Why cli does not protect us from that is beyond me.
    
    The simple fix is to match ia64 and provide a smp_call_function_single.
    Which avoids the broadcast and is more efficient.
    
    This certainly fixes the problem of getting stuck on boot which was
    very easy to trigger on my SMP Hyperthreaded Xeon, and I think
    it fixes it for the right reasons.

    It seems that I see a bug in hidinput_hid_event.  The check for NULL can never

    [PATCH] USB: fix in usb_calc_bus_time
    
    This patch does the same swap, i.e. use the ISO macro if (isoc).
    Additionally, it fixes the return value - the usb_calc_bus_time function
    returns the time in nanoseconds (I didn't notice that before) while the
    HS_USECS and HS_USECS_ISO are microseconds.  This fixes the function to
    return nanoseconds always, and adjusts ehci-q.c (the only high-speed
    caller of the function) to wrap the call in NS_TO_US().

    [PATCH] USB: Usbcore: Don't try to delete unregistered interfaces
    
    This patch handles a rarely-encountered failure mode in usbcore.  It's
    legal for device_add to fail (although now it happens even more rarely
    than before since failure to bind a driver is no longer fatal).  So when
    we destroy the interfaces in a configuration, we shouldn't try to delete
    ones which weren't successfully registered.  Also, failure to register an
    interface shouldn't be fatal either -- I think; you may disagree about
    this part of the patch.

    [PATCH] PCI: remove PCI_BRIDGE_CTL_VGA handling from setup-bus.c
    
    The setup-bus code doesn't work correctly for configurations
    with more than one display adapter in the same PCI domain.
    This stuff actually is a leftover of an early 2.4 PCI setup code
    and apparently it stopped working after some "bridge_ctl" changes.
    So the best thing we can do is just to remove it and rely on the fact
    that any firmware *has* to configure VGA port forwarding for the boot
    display device properly.
    
    But then we need to ensure that the bus->bridge_ctl will always
    contain valid information collected at the probe time, therefore
    the following change in pci_scan_bridge() is needed.

    [PATCH] I2C: 24RF08 corruption prevention (again)
    
    The 24RF08 corruption prevention in the eeprom and max6875 drivers wasn't
    complete. For one thing, the additional quick write should happen as soon
    as possible and unconditionally, while both drivers had error paths before.
    For another, when a given chip is forced, the core does not emit a quick
    write, so a second quick write would cause the corruption rather than
    prevent it.
    
    I plan to move the corruption prevention in the core in the long run, so
    that individual drivers don't have to care anymore. But I need to merge
    i2c_probe and i2c_detect before I do (work in progress).

    [PATCH] x86_64 machine_kexec: Cleanup inline assembly.
    
    In an uncensored copy of code from i386 to x86_64 I wound up
    with inline assembly with the wrong constraints.  Use input
    constraints instead of output constraints.
    
    So I know the assembler will do the right thing specify the size
    of the operand lidtq and lgdtq instead of just lidt and lgdt.
    
    Make load_segments use an input constraint, and delete the macro fun.
    Without having to reload %cs like I do on i386 this code is noticeably
    simpler.

    [PATCH] i386 machine_kexec: Cleanup inline assembly
    
    For some reason I was telling my inline assembly that the
    input argument was an output argument.
    
    Playing in the trampoline code I have seen a couple of
    instances where lgdt get the wrong size (because the
    trampolines run in 16bit mode) so use lgdtl and lidtl to
    be explicit.
    
    Additionally gcc-3.3 and gcc-3.4 want's an lvalue for a
    memory argument and it doesn't think an array of characters
    is an lvalue so use a packed structure instead.

    [PATCH] re-disable TSC on NUMAQ
    
    Somewhere recently, the TSC got re-enabled for timekeeping on NUMAQ
    machines.  However, the hardware makes these get unsynchronized quite
    badly.  So badly, in fact, that the code to fix up the skew can just hang
    on boot.
    
    This patch re-disables them.  It's nicely confined to the numaq.c file.  It
    would be great if this could make it into 2.6.13, I think it counts as a
    bugfix.

    [PATCH] posix timers: fix normalization problem
    
    (We found this (after a customer complained) and it is in the kernel.org
    kernel.  Seems that for CLOCK_MONOTONIC absolute timers and clock_nanosleep
    calls both the request time and wall_to_monotonic are subtracted prior to
    the normalize resulting in an overflow in the existing normalize test.
    This causes the result to be shifted ~4 seconds ahead instead of ~2 seconds
    back in time.)
    
    The normalize code in posix-timers.c fails when the tv_nsec member is ~1.2
    seconds negative.  This can happen on absolute timers (and
    clock_nanosleeps) requested on CLOCK_MONOTONIC (both the request time and
    wall_to_monotonic are subtracted resulting in the possibility of a number
    close to -2 seconds.)
    
    This fix uses the set_normalized_timespec() (which does not have an
    overflow problem) to fix the problem and as a side effect makes the code
    cleaner.

    [PATCH] uml: fix TT mode by reverting "use fork instead of clone"
    
    With Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
    
    Revert the following patch, because of miscompilation problems in different
    environments leading to UML not working *at all* in TT mode; it was merged
    lately in 2.6 development cycle, a little after being written, and has
    caused problems to lots of people; I know it's a bit too long, but it
    shouldn't have been merged in first place, so I still apply for inclusion
    in the -stable tree.  Anyone using this feature currently is either using
    some older kernel (some reports even used 2.6.12-rc4-mm2) or using this
    patch, as included in my -bs patchset.
    
    For now there's not yet a fix for this patch, so for now the best thing is
    to drop it (which was widely reported to give a working kernel, and as such
    was even merged in -stable tree).
    
    "Convert the boot-time host ptrace testing from clone to fork.  They were
    essentially doing fork anyway.  This cleans up the code a bit, and makes
    valgrind a bit happier about grinding it."

    [PATCH] device-mapper: fix md->lock deadlocks in core
    
    This patch is an attempt to fix deadlocks discovered in the core dm.
    
    The problems boil down to md->lock having to be held in too many places, so
    I've split it into two: md->suspend_lock and md->io_lock.
    
    suspend_lock is now held throughout dm_suspended() as well as dm_resume()
    and dm_swap_table() so that these functions cannot run concurrently:
    there's no requirement for that and it added complexity.
    
    DMF_FS_LOCKED becomes redundant: DMF_SUSPENDED provides adequate
    protection.

    Without this patch, intel x86_64 boxes with hyperthreading disabled in the
    bios (and which rely on srat for numa setup) endup having incorrect values in
    cpu_to_node[] arrays, causing sched domains to be built incorrectly etc.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Fix gcc 4 warning in sched_find_first_bit
    
    This patch eliminates the GCC4 warning on the x86_64 platform:
    
    kernel/sched.c:1824: warning: control may reach end of non-void function
    'sched_find_first_bit' being inlined.
    
    The change follows the lead of others, i.e.  it is guaranteed that at least
    one of b[0], b[1], or b[2] will have a bit set and evaluate to true.  That
    being said, GCC4.0.0 notices that the code flow does not return anything if
    b[0], b[1] and b[2] are not true.  Since we know better, if it's not b[0] or
    b[1], it has to be b[2].

    [PATCH] x86_64: cpu hotplug changes kills nmi watchdog
    
    When the x86_64 cpu hotplug changes went in it added a check in
    default_do_nmi() which kills NMI delivery on any CPU but the BSP.
    
    The NMI watchdog is brought up quite some time before the online bit is set
    in num_online_cpus so this won't work very well.  The nmi watchdogs on cpus
    that are not BSP will never be reprogrammed and no NMIs.
    
    Why was this check added? How does an offlined cpu receive an NMI?

    [PATCH] [IB/cm]: Correct CM port redirect reject codes
    
    Reject code 24 is port and CM redirection, not just port redirection.
    Port redirection alone is code 25.
    
    Therefore we should rename code 24 to IB_CM_REJ_PORT_CM_REDIRECT and
    use IB_CM_REJ_PORT_REDIRECT for code 25.

    libata: Check PCI sub-class code before disabling AHCI
    
    This patch adds functionality to check the PCI sub-class code of an
    AHCI capable device before disabling AHCI.  It fixes a bug where an
    ICH7 sata controller is being setup by the BIOS as sub-class 1 (ide)
    and the AHCI control registers weren't being initialized, thus causing
    an IO error in piix_disable_ahci().

    Since ARMv6 CPUs will not flush the TLB on context switches, it is

    Revert broken "statement with no effect" warning fix
    
    It may shut up gcc, but it also incorrectly changes the semantics of the
    smp_call_function() helpers.
    
    You can fix the warning other ways if you are interested (create another
    inline function that takes no arguments and returns zero), but
    preferably gcc just shouldn't complain about unused return values from
    statement expressions in the first place.

    powernow-k8 requires that a data structure for
    each core be created in the _cpu_init function
    call.  The cpufreq infrastructure doesn't call
    _cpu_init for the second core in each processor.
    Some systems crashed when _get was called with
    an odd-numbered core because it tried to
    dereference a NULL pointer since the data
    structure had not been created.
    
    The attached patch solves the problem by
    initializing data structures for all shared
    cores in the _cpu_init function.  It should
    apply to 2.6.12-rc6 and has been tested by
    AMD and Sun.

    [PATCH] alpha: fix "statement with no effect" warnings
    
    Apparently gcc 4.0 complains about "({ 0; });", which leads to -Werror
    breakage in one of the alpha oprofile modules.
    
    One might could argue that this is a gcc bug, in that statement-expressions
    should be considered to be function-like rather than statement-like for the
    purposes of this warning.  But it's just as easy to use an inline function
    in the first place, side-stepping the issue.

    [PATCH] SELinux: default labeling of MLS field
    
    Implement kernel labeling of the MLS (multilevel security) field of
    security contexts for files which have no existing MLS field.  This is to
    enable upgrades of a system from non-MLS to MLS without performing a full
    filesystem relabel including all of the mountpoints, which would be quite
    painful for users.
    
    With this patch, with MLS enabled, if a file has no MLS field, the kernel
    internally adds an MLS field to the in-core inode (but not to the on-disk
    file).  This MLS field added is the default for the superblock, allowing
    per-mountpoint control over the values via fixed policy or mount options.
    
    This patch has been tested by enabling MLS without relabeling its
    filesystem, and seems to be working correctly.

    This patch:
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bk-commits-head&m=111955644929114&w=2
    uncovered a k7m bios bug, where the VT82C686A router is reported as
    being "586-compatible". The two chips have different pirq mapping, so
    this leads to "irq routing conflict" on many pci devices.
    
    The suggested fix was discussed with Aleksey Gorelov, who helped me
    to identify the problem as a probable bios bug.

    So after deleting the first volume you hit a null pointer on the second

    [PATCH] pcmcia: fix sharing IRQs and request_irq without IRQ_HANDLE_PRESENT
    
    Debugging and description from: Noah Misch <noah@cs.caltech.edu>
    
    When a driver calls pcmcia_request_irq with IRQ_HANDLE_PRESENT unset, it looks
    for an open IRQ by request_irq()ing with a dummy handler and NULL dev_info.
    free_irq uses dev_info as a key for identifying the handler to free among
    those sharing an IRQ, so request_irq returns -EINVAL if dev_info is NULL and
    the IRQ may be shared.  That unknown error code is the -EINVAL.
    
    It looks like only pcnet_cs and axnet_cs are affected.  Most other drivers let
    pcmcia_request_irq install their interrupt handlers.  sym53c500_cs requests
    its IRQ manually, but it cannot share an IRQ.
    
    The appended patch changes pcmcia_request_irq to pass an arbitrary, unique,
    non-NULL dev_info with the dummy handler.

    [ALSA] cleanup and typo-correction
    
    ALSA Core
    This patch changes, adds and remove some comments, which will
    make now more sense and fit on a 80-char line. It also changes
    the order of snd_power_wait() to make the file more readable.
    It removes the device.c comment in front of _snd_minor,
    cause snd_minor has nothing to do with device.c.
    The both typos in the kernel-docs were corrected too.

    [PATCH] ppc32: 8xx avoid icbi misbehaviour in __flush_dcache_icache_phys
    
    On 8xx, in the case where a pagefault happens for a process who's not
    the owner of the vma in question (ptrace for instance), the flush
    operation is performed via the physical address.
    
    Unfortunately, that results in a strange, unexplainable "icbi"
    instruction fault, most likely due to a CPU bug (see oops below).
    
    Avoid that by flushing the page via its kernel virtual address.

    [PATCH] fbdev: update info->cmap when setting cmap from user-/kernelspace.
    
    The fb_info struct, as defined in include/linux/fb.h, contains an element
    that is supposed to hold the current color map:
      struct fb_cmap cmap;            /* Current cmap */
    
    This cmap is currently never updated when either fb_set_cmap() or
    fb_set_user_cmap() are called.  As a result, info->cmap contains the
    default cmap that was set by a device driver/fbcon and a userspace
    application using the FBIOGETCMAP ioctl will not always get the *currently*
    used color map.
    
    The patch fixes this by making sure the cmap is copied to info->cmap after
    it is set correctly.  It moves most of the code that is responsible for
    setting the cmap to fb_set_cmap() and out of fb_set_user_cmap() to avoid
    code-duplication.

    [PATCH] fbcon: don't repaint the cursor when it is disabled.
    
    Currently even when the cursor is disabled (`setterm -cursor off`), it is
    still repainted as a black rectangle the size of a single char.  This can
    be seen, for example, by chvt'ing to a free tty, disabling the cursor and
    doing `dd if=3D/dev/urandom of=3D/dev/fb0`.
    
    The patch changes this behaviour by avoiding painting anything when the
    cursor is disabled.

    [PATCH] cpm_uart: use DPRAM for early console
    
    m8xx_cpm_hostalloc() can't rely on using the coherent DMA allocator early

    DPRAM instead.
    
    The current code relies on the "bootmem_page" allocated by
    m8xx_cpm_reset(), which must be killed.
    
    This is done in v2.4 but has never been forward ported to v2.6.

    [PATCH] dvb: rename lgdt3302 frontend module to lgdt330x
    
    Rename lgdt3302 to lgdt330x, to make way for the addition of lgdt3303
    support in future revisions.
    
    I am changing the name of this module now so that hopefully the name will
    be changed before the release of 2.6.13 ...  It wouldn't make sense to
    release 2.6.13 with the name lgdt3302 in it, which will only be renamed to
    lgdt330x in later versions.

    [PATCH] v4l: fix tuning with MXB driver
    
    I noticed that some past changes to the gerneric Video4Linux tuner module
    for analog tuners broke my "Multimedia eXtension Board" driver.
    
    The tuner driver was made aware of Video4Linux2 tuning ioctls, but my
    driver was not ported and still uses the Video4Linux1 ioctls.  This does
    not work anymore as intendend, the tuning is currently broken.
    
    The attached patch fixes non-working tuning in MXB driver introduced by
    some recent generic tuner changes by replacing Video4Linux1 tuner ioctls
    with proper Video4Linux2 tuner ioctls.

    [PATCH] DVICO Fusion DVB-T1 Tuner (LG-Z201) fix
    
    It is a small modification to the table that defines the way that the
    LG-Z201 tuner is controlled for the DVICO Fusion DVB-T1 tuner card.
    
    I believe that a mistake was made when the dvb tuner code was reorganised
    (to use a generic table for the tuner information instead of inline code)
    and as a result, the DVICO card doesn't tune properly.
    
    The modification I have made to the table makes it behave like it did with
    the old inline tuner code that worked.  The patch is on top of the 2.6.12
    kernel.

    [PATCH] tpm: Support for Infineon TPM
    
    This patch provides a new device driver for the Infineon SLD 9630 TT Trusted
    Platform Module (TPM 1.1b) [1] which is embedded on Intel- mainboards or in
    HP/ Fujitsu-Siemens / Toshiba-Notebooks.  A nearly complete list where this
    module is integrated in can be found in [2].
    
    This kernel module acts as a communication gateway between the linux kernel
    and the hardware chip and fits the TPM-specific interfaces created by IBM in
    drivers/char/tpm/tpm.h
    
    Further information about this module and a list of succesfully tested and
    therefore supported hardware can be found at our project page [3].

    [PATCH] stale POSIX lock handling
    
    I believe that there is a problem with the handling of POSIX locks, which
    the attached patch should address.
    
    The problem appears to be a race between fcntl(2) and close(2).  A
    multithreaded application could close a file descriptor at the same time as
    it is trying to acquire a lock using the same file descriptor.  I would
    suggest that that multithreaded application is not providing the proper
    synchronization for itself, but the OS should still behave correctly.
    
    SUS3 (Single UNIX Specification Version 3, read: POSIX) indicates that when
    a file descriptor is closed, that all POSIX locks on the file, owned by the
    process which closed the file descriptor, should be released.
    
    The trick here is when those locks are released.  The current code releases
    all locks which exist when close is processing, but any locks in progress
    are handled when the last reference to the open file is released.
    
    There are three cases to consider.
    
    One is the simple case, a multithreaded (mt) process has a file open and
    races to close it and acquire a lock on it.  In this case, the close will
    release one reference to the open file and when the fcntl is done, it will
    release the other reference.  For this situation, no locks should exist on
    the file when both the close and fcntl operations are done.  The current
    system will handle this case because the last reference to the open file is
    being released.
    
    The second case is when the mt process has dup(2)'d the file descriptor.
    The close will release one reference to the file and the fcntl, when done,
    will release another, but there will still be at least one more reference
    to the open file.  One could argue that the existence of a lock on the file
    after the close has completed is okay, because it was acquired after the
    close operation and there is still a way for the application to release the
    lock on the file, using an existing file descriptor.
    
    The third case is when the mt process has forked, after opening the file
    and either before or after becoming an mt process.  In this case, each
    process would hold a reference to the open file.  For each process, this
    degenerates to first case above.  However, the lock continues to exist
    until both processes have released their references to the open file.  This
    lock could block other lock requests.
    
    The changes to release the lock when the last reference to the open file
    aren't quite right because they would allow the lock to exist as long as
    there was a reference to the open file.  This is too long.
    
    The new proposed solution is to add support in the fcntl code path to
    detect a race with close and then to release the lock which was just
    acquired when such as race is detected.  This causes locks to be released
    in a timely fashion and for the system to conform to the POSIX semantic
    specification.
    
    This was tested by instrumenting a kernel to detect the handling locks and
    then running a program which generates case #3 above.  A dangling lock
    could be reliably generated.  When the changes to detect the close/fcntl
    race were added, a dangling lock could no longer be generated.

    [PATCH] s390: fba dasd i/o errors
    
    The FBA discipline does not use retries for failed requests.  A request fails
    after the first unsuccessful start attempt.  There are some rare conditions
    (e.g.  CIO path recovery) in which the start of an i/o on a fba device can
    fail.  A tiny amount of retries is therefore reasonable.

    [PATCH] s390: external call performance
    
    The kernel uses the SIGP external call order code to signal other CPUs.  When
    running with dedicated CPUs external calls don't get delivered immediately but
    within a fixed polling invervall.  This can lead to delays where the system
    appears to do nothing.  Replace the SIGP external call order with the SIGP
    emergency call order since this one gets delivered immediately.

    [PATCH] s390: find_next_{zero}_bit fixes
    
    The find_next_{zero}_bit primitives on s390* should never return a bit number
    bigger then the bit field size.  In the case of a bitfield that doesn't end on
    a word boundary, an offset that makes the search start at the last word of the
    bit field and the last word doesn't contain any zero/one bits the search is
    continued with a call to find_first_bit with a negative size.  The search
    normally ends pretty quickly because the words following the bit field contain
    a mix of zeros and ones.  But the bit number that is returned in this case is
    too big.
    
    To fix this and additional if to check for this case is needed.  To make the
    code easier to read I removed the assembler parts from the
    find_next_{zero}_bit functions, the C-ified code is as good.

    [PATCH] s390: spin lock retry
    
    Split spin lock and r/w lock implementation into a single try which is done
    inline and an out of line function that repeatedly tries to get the lock
    before doing the cpu_relax().  Add a system control to set the number of
    retries before a cpu is yielded.
    
    The reason for the spin lock retry is that the diagnose 0x44 that is used to
    give up the virtual cpu is quite expensive.  For spin locks that are held only
    for a short period of time the costs of the diagnoses outweights the savings
    for spin locks that are held for a longer timer.  The default retry count is
    1000.

    [PATCH] ppc64: remove another fixed address constraint
    
    Presently the LparMap, one of the structures the kernel shares with the
    legacy iSeries hypervisor has a fixed offset address in head.S.  This patch
    changes this so the LparMap is a normally initialized structure, without
    fixed address.  This allows us to use macros to compute some of the values
    in the structure, which wasn't previously possible because the assembler
    always uses signed-% which gets the wrong answers for the computations in
    question.
    
    Unfortunately, a gcc bug means that doing this requires another structure
    (hvReleaseData) to be initialized in asm instead of C, but on the whole the
    result is cleaner than before.

    [PATCH] ppc64: dynamically allocate segment tables
    
    PPC64 machines before Power4 need a segment table page allocated for each
    CPU.  Currently these are allocated statically in a big array in head.S for
    all CPUs.  The segment tables need to be in the first segment (so
    do_stab_bolted doesn't take a recursive fault on the stab itself), but
    other than that there are no constraints which require the stabs for the
    secondary CPUs to be statically allocated.
    
    This patch allocates segment tables dynamically during boot, using
    lmb_alloc() to ensure they are within the first 256M segment.  This reduces
    the kernel image size by 192k...
    
    Tested on RS64 iSeries, POWER3 pSeries, and POWER5.

    [PATCH] Remove bogus warning in page_alloc.c
    
    Originally __free_pages_bulk used the relative page number within a zone to
    define its buddies.  This meant that to maintain the "maximally aligned"
    requirements (that an allocation of size N will be aligned at least to N
    physically) zones had to also be aligned to 1<<MAX_ORDER pages.  When
    __free_pages_bulk was updated to use the relative page frame numbers of the
    free'd pages to pair buddies this released the alignment constraint on the
    'left' edge of the zone.  This allows _either_ edge of the zone to contain
    partial MAX_ORDER sized buddies.  These simply never will have matching
    buddies and thus will never make it to the 'top' of the pyramid.
    
    The patch below removes a now redundant check ensuring that the mem_map was
    aligned to MAX_ORDER.

    Fix bug identifued by Richard Purdie <rpurdie@rpsys.net>.
    
    oprofile calls check_user_page_readable() from interrupt context, so we
    deadlock over various VFS locks.
    
    But check_user_page_readable() doesn't imply either a read or a write of the
    page's contents.  Change __follow_page() so that check_user_page_readable()
    can tell __follow_page() that we're not accessing the page's contents, and use
    that info to avoid the troublesome lock-takings.
    
    Also, make follow_page() inline for the single callsite in memory.c to save a
    bit of stack space.

    [PATCH] ub: fix for blank CDs
    
    This patch fixes a microcode lockup in my CD-ROM adapters when a blank CD
    is inserted.  However, do not try to burn CDs yet!  I'm pretty sure that
    trying it will end in coasters.
    
     - Fix a few cases where we were unable to resynchronize with replies
       for previous commands. The main thing is to keep reading replies
       in case of a stall. This is done with the new state CLRRS.
     - Since I am forgetting the basic state machine already, document it.
     - Move counter increments in the looping path in its own function.

    [PATCH] i4l: add Olitec ISDN PCI card in hisax gazel driver
    
    This patch adds support for the Olitec ISDN PCI card in the hisax gazel
    driver.  The gazel driver supports this card, but wasn't aware of its PCI
    ids.  Users used to modify the PCI ids of a supported card in
    include/linux/pci_ids.h and recompile their kernel to get this card
    running, as said in most Howtos.  This patch makes the hisax gazel driver
    recognize the PCI ids of the Olitec ISDN PCI card.

    This resolves entry #4863 in the OSDL bugzilla.  Although in that bug
    report the failure occurred because of a confusion over scanning vs.
    rescanning, in general add_sdev can fail for a number of reasons (the
    simplest being insufficient memory) and the caller should cope properly.

    [PATCH] reiserfs: fix deadlock in inode creation failure path w/ default ACL
    
    reiserfs_new_inode() can call iput() with the xattr lock held.  This will
    cause a deadlock to occur when reiserfs_delete_xattrs() is called to clean
    up.
    
    The following patch releases the lock and reacquires it after the iput.
    This is safe because interaction with xattrs is complete, and the relock is
    just to balance out the release in the caller.
    
    The locking needs some reworking to be more sane, but that's more intrusive
    and I was just looking to fix this bug.

    [IA64] unwind.c uses wrong unat from switch_stack
    
    unwind.c can read the wrong unat bits from switch_stack.
    sw->caller_unat is the value of ar.unat when the task was blocked.
    sw->ar_unat is the value of ar.unat after doing st8.spill for r4-7.
    IOW, ar_unat is caller_unat with 4 bits changed.
    
    unw_access_gr() uses sw->ar_unat for r4-7 (correct), but it also uses
    sw->ar_unat for other scratch registers (incorrect).  sw->ar_unat
    should only be used for r4-7, everything else should use
    sw->caller_unat, unless modified by unwind info.  Using sw->ar_unat
    risks picking up the 4 bits that were overwritten when r4-7 were saved.
    
    Also this line is wrong
    	unw.sw_off[unw.preg_index[UNW_REG_PFS]] = SW(AR_UNAT);
    and should be
    	unw.sw_off[unw.preg_index[UNW_REG_PFS]] = SW(AR_PFS);

    JFS: Improve sync barrier processing
    
    Under heavy load, hot metadata pages are often locked by non-committed
    transactions, making them difficult to flush to disk.  This prevents
    the sync point from advancing past a transaction that had modified the
    page.
    
    There is a point during the sync barrier processing where all
    outstanding transactions have been committed to disk, but no new
    transaction have been allowed to proceed.  This is the best time
    to write the metadata.

    [PATCH] Fix RLIMIT_RTPRIO breakage
    
    RLIMIT_RTPRIO is supposed to grant non privileged users the right to use
    SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR scheduling policies with priorites bounded by the
    RLIMIT_RTPRIO value via sched_setscheduler(). This is usually used by
    audio users.
    
    Unfortunately this is broken in 2.6.13rc3 as you can see in the excerpt
    from sched_setscheduler below:
    
            /*
             * Allow unprivileged RT tasks to decrease priority:
             */
            if (!capable(CAP_SYS_NICE)) {
                    /* can't change policy */
                    if (policy != p->policy)
                            return -EPERM;
    
    After the above unconditional test which causes sched_setscheduler to
    fail with no regard to the RLIMIT_RTPRIO value the following check is made:
    
                   /* can't increase priority */
                    if (policy != SCHED_NORMAL &&
                        param->sched_priority > p->rt_priority &&
                        param->sched_priority >
                                    p->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_RTPRIO].rlim_cur)
                            return -EPERM;
    
    Thus I do believe that the RLIMIT_RTPRIO value must be taken into
    account for the policy check, especially as the RLIMIT_RTPRIO limit is
    of no use without this change.
    
    The attached patch fixes this problem.

    [PATCH] acpi: Don't call acpi_sleep_prepare from acpi_power_off
    
    Now that all of the code paths that call acpi_power_off
    have been modified to call either call kernel_power_off
    (which calls apci_sleep_prepare by way of acpi_shutdown)
    or to call acpi_sleep_prepare directly it is redundant to call
    acpi_sleep_prepare from acpi_power_off.
    
    So simplify the code and simply don't call acpi_sleep_prepare.
    
    In addition there is a little error handling done so if we
    can't register the acpi class we don't hook pm_power_off.
    
    I think I have done the right thing with the CONFIG_PM define
    but I'm not certain.  Can this code even be compiled if
    CONFIG_PM is false?

    [PATCH] acpi_power_off: Don't switch to the boot cpu
    
    machine_power_off on i386 and x86_64 now switch to the

    is a good idea on reboot, so for those architectures it is a noop.
    I can't see anything in the acpi spec that requires you to be on
    the boot cpu to power off the system, so this should not be an issue
    for ia64.  In addition ia64 has the altix a massive multi-node
    system where switching to the boot cpu sounds insane as we may
    hot removed the boot cpu.

    [PATCH] i386 machine_power_off cleanup
    
    Call machine_shutdown() to move to the boot cpu
    and disable apics.  Both acpi_power_off and
    apm_power_off want to move to the boot cpu.
    and we are already disabling the local apics
    so calling machine_shutdown simply reuses
    code.
    
    ia64 doesn't have a special path in power_off
    for efi so there is no reason i386 should.  If
    we really need to call the efi power off path
    the efi driver can set pm_power_off like everyone
    else.

    [PATCH] pcwd.c: Call kernel_power_off not machine_power_off
    
    The call appears to come from process context so kernel_power_off
    should be safe.  And acpi_power_off won't necessarily work if you just
    call machine_power_off.

    [PATCH] swpsuspend: Have suspend to disk use factors of sys_reboot
    
    The suspend to disk code was a poor copy of the code in
    sys_reboot now that we have kernel_power_off, kernel_restart
    and kernel_halt use them instead of poorly duplicating them inline.

    [PATCH] 68328serial: sysrq should use emergency_reboot
    
    The 68328serial.c driver has a weird local reimplementation of
    magic sysrq.  The code is architecture specific enough that calling
    machine_restart() is probably ok.  But there is no reason not to call
    emergency_restart() so do so.

    reboot the machine, and increase our chances of actually

    machine_restart, machine_halt and machine_power_off are machine

    [PATCH] Add emergency_restart()
    
    When the kernel is working well and we want to restart cleanly
    kernel_restart is the function to use.   But in many instances
    the kernel wants to reboot when thing are expected to be working
    very badly such as from panic or a software watchdog handler.
    
    This patch adds the function emergency_restart() so that
    callers can be clear what semantics they expect when calling
    restart.  emergency_restart() is expected to be callable
    from interrupt context and possibly reliable in even more
    trying circumstances.
    
    This is an initial generic implementation for all architectures.

    [PATCH] ARM: 2819/1: Fix several S3C24x0 IIS defines
    
    Patch from Dimitry Andric
    
    - Change S3C2440_IISCON_MPLL to S3C2440_IISMOD_MPLL:
      The S3C2440 IISCON register doesn\'t control the master clock selection, this is done with the IISMOD register.
    - Correct S3C2410_IISMOD_256FS and S3C2410_IISMOD_384FS:
      This is set via bit 2 of IISMOD, not bit 1.
    - Add S3C2410_IISCON_PSCEN (prescaler enable), for completeness\' sake.

    If a metadata page is kept active, it is possible that the sync barrier logic

    Remove "noreplacement" kernel command line option.
    
    It is no longer valid to not replace instructions, since we depend on
    different behaviour depending on CPU capabilities.
    
    If you need to limit the capabilities of the replacements (because the
    boot CPU has features that non-boot CPU's do not have, for example), you
    need to explicitly disable those capabilities that are not shared across
    all CPU's.
    
    For example, if your boot CPU has FXSR, but other CPU's in your system
    do not, you need to use the "nofxsr" kernel command line, not disable
    instruction replacement per se.

    x86: use alternative instructions for fnsave/fxsave too
    
    This one ends up using an inline asm format that claims to read memory
    and then clobber it (rather than just write it directly), which made it
    easier to use the existing "alternative_input()" infrastructure support.
    
    Now the fxsave code matches the fxrstor.

    x86: make restore_fpu() use alternative assembler instructions
    
    It's really just a single instruction, conditional on whether the CPU
    supports FXSR or not, so implement it as such instead of making it a
    function that queries FXSR dynamically.
    
    This means that the instruction just gets automatically rewritten to the
    correct one at boot-time.

    [NETFILTER]: Fix potential memory corruption in NAT code (aka memory NAT)
    
    The portptr pointing to the port in the conntrack tuple is declared static,
    which could result in memory corruption when two packets of the same
    protocol are NATed at the same time and one conntrack goes away.

    Fix up incorrect "unlikely()" on %gs reload in x86 __switch_to
    
    These days %gs is normally the TLS segment, so it's no longer zero.  As
    a result, we shouldn't just assume that %fs/%gs tend to be zero
    together, but test them independently instead.
    
    Also, fix setting of debug registers to use the "next" pointer instead
    of "current".  It so happens that the scheduler will have set the new
    current pointer before calling __switch_to(), but that's just an
    implementation detail.

    [NETFILTER]: ip_conntrack_expect_related must not free expectation
    
    If a connection tracking helper tells us to expect a connection, and
    we're already expecting that connection, we simply free the one they
    gave us and return success.
    
    The problem is that NAT helpers (eg. FTP) have to allocate the
    expectation first (to see what port is available) then rewrite the
    packet.  If that rewrite fails, they try to remove the expectation,
    but it was freed in ip_conntrack_expect_related.
    
    This is one example of a larger problem: having registered the
    expectation, the pointer is no longer ours to use.  Reference counting
    is needed for ctnetlink anyway, so introduce it now.
    
    To have a single "put" path, we need to grab the reference to the
    connection on creation, rather than open-coding it in the caller.

    The current call to __qdisc_dequeue_head leads to a branch
    misprediction for every loop iteration, the fact that the
    most common priority is 2 makes this even worse.  This issue

    Patch from Alexander Schulz
    
    Up to now, shark kernels were limited to one megabyte compressed
    size. As the kernels get bigger, this becomes more and more
    uncomfortable. So I added a loop to copy 3 MB instead of one
    and added some comments.

    [PATCH] ARM: Remove global nwfpe register variable
    
    Recent changes to nwfpe broke the build with some gcc versions:
    
    In file included from arch/arm/nwfpe/softfloat.c:33:
    arch/arm/nwfpe/fpa11.h:32: global register variable follows a function definition
    make[1]: *** [arch/arm/nwfpe/softfloat.o] Error 1
    
    Since we now ensure that the kernel stack is empty when returning
    to user space, we can now access the userspace registers with
    reference to the kernel stack using current_thread_info(), rather
    than remembering the stack pointer at the time nwfpe was called.

    state on mapping to userland is bogus.  None of the code patchs involved

    JFS: fsync wrong behavior when I/O failure occurs
    
    This is half of a patch that Qu Fuping submitted in April.  The first part
    was applied to fs/mpage.c in 2.6.12-rc4.
    
    jfs_fsync should return error, but it doesn't wait for the metadata page to
    be uptodate, e.g.:
    jfs_fsync->jfs_commit_inode->txCommit->diWrite->read_metapage->
    __get_metapage->read_cache_page reads a page from disk. Because read is
    async, when read_cache_page: err = filler(data, page), filler will not
    return error, it just submits I/O request and returns. So, page is not
    uptodate.  Checking only if(IS_ERROR(mp->page)) is not enough, we should
    add "|| !PageUptodate(mp->page)"

    Input: psmouse - wheel mice (imps, exps) always have 3rd button
    
    There are wheel mice that respond to Logitech probes and report
    that they have only 2 buttons (such as e-Aser mouse) and this
    stops the wheel from being used as a middle button. Change the
    driver to always report BTN_MIDDLE capability if a wheel is
    present.
    
    Also, never reset BTN_RIGHT capability in logips2pp code - there
    are no Logitech mice that have only one button and if some other
    mice happen to respond to Logitech's query we could do the wrong
    thing.

    This patch makes the command:
    
    make ARCH=um SUBARCH=i386
    
    work on x86_64 hosts (with support for building 32-bit binaries).  This is
    especially needed since 64-bit UMLs don't support 32-bit emulation for guest
    binaries, currently.  This has been tested in all possible cases and works.
    
    Only exception is that I've built but not tested a 64-bit binary, because I
    hadn't a 64-bit filesystem available.

       into: .remap_data : { arch/um/sys-i386 /unmap_fin.o (.data .bss) }
    
    (because I didn't use ## to join the two tokens), thus stopping linking.  Pass
    the whole path from the Makefile as a simple and nice fix.

    [PATCH] uml: workaround host bug in "TT mode vs. NPTL link fix"
    
    A big bug has been diagnosed on hosts running the SKAS patch and built with
    CONFIG_REGPARM, due to some missing prevent_tail_call().
    
    On these hosts, this workaround is needed to avoid triggering that bug,
    because "to" is kept by GCC only in EBX, which is corrupted at the return of
    mmap2().
    
    Since to trigger this bug int 0x80 must be used when doing the call, it rarely
    manifests itself, so I'd prefer to get this merged to workaround that host
    bug, since it should cause no functional change.  Still, you might prefer to
    drop it, I'll leave this to you.

    [PATCH] uml: fix lvalue for gcc4
    
          Russell King <rmk+lkml@arm.linux.org.uk>
    
    This construct is refused by GCC 4, so here's the (corrected) fix.  Thanks to
    Russell for noticing a stupid mistake I did when first sending this.
    
    As he noted, the code is largely suboptimal however it currently works, and
    will be fixed shortly.  Just read the access_ok check on fp which is NULL, or
    the pointer arithmetic below which should be done with a cast to void*:
    
     	frame = (struct rt_sigframe __user *)
     		round_down(stack_top - sizeof(struct rt_sigframe), 16) - 8;
    
    The code shows clearly that has been taken from
    arch/x86_64/kernel/signal.c:setup_rt_frame(), maybe in a bit of a hurry.

    [SCSI] add int_to_scsilun() function
    
    One of the issues we had was reverting the midlayers lun value
    into the 8byte lun value that we wanted to send to the device.
    Historically, there's been some combination of byte swapping,
    setting high/low, etc. There's also been no common thread between
    how our driver did it and others.  I also got very confused as
    to why byteswap routines were being used.
    
    Anyway, this patch is a LLDD-callable function that reverts the
    midlayer's lun value, stored in an int, to the 8-byte quantity
    (note: this is not the real 8byte quantity, just the same amount
    that scsilun_to_int() was able to convert and store originally).
    
    This also solves the dilemma of the thread:
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112116767118981&w=2
    
    A patch for the lpfc driver to use this function will be along
    in a few days (batched with other patches).

    Due to the inherent behaviour (an immediate scan) of adding

    split the registration into two steps -- addition as
    unknown-type role, then use fc_remote_port_rolchg() with
    appropriate role (based on PLOGI/PRLI bits).  This allows
    for a more cleaner rport->dd_data management as can be seen

    [PATCH] Fix soft lockup due to NTFS: VFS part and explanation
    
    Something has changed in the core kernel such that we now get concurrent
    inode write outs, one e.g via pdflush and one via sys_sync or whatever.
    This causes a nasty deadlock in ntfs.  The only clean solution
    unfortunately requires a minor vfs api extension.
    
    First the deadlock analysis:
    
    Prerequisive knowledge: NTFS has a file $MFT (inode 0) loaded at mount
    time.  The NTFS driver uses the page cache for storing the file contents as
    usual.  More interestingly this file contains the table of on-disk inodes
    as a sequence of MFT_RECORDs.  Thus NTFS driver accesses the on-disk inodes
    by accessing the MFT_RECORDs in the page cache pages of the loaded inode
    $MFT.
    
    The situation: VFS inode X on a mounted ntfs volume is dirty.  For same
    inode X, the ntfs_inode is dirty and thus corresponding on-disk inode,
    which is as explained above in a dirty PAGE_CACHE_PAGE belonging to the
    table of inodes ($MFT, inode 0).
    
    What happens:
    
    Process 1: sys_sync()/umount()/whatever...  calls __sync_single_inode() for
    $MFT -> do_writepages() -> write_page for the dirty page containing the
    on-disk inode X, the page is now locked -> ntfs_write_mst_block() which
    clears PageUptodate() on the page to prevent anyone else getting hold of it
    whilst it does the write out (this is necessary as the on-disk inode needs
    "fixups" applied before the write to disk which are removed again after the
    write and PageUptodate is then set again).  It then analyses the page
    looking for dirty on-disk inodes and when it finds one it calls
    ntfs_may_write_mft_record() to see if it is safe to write this on-disk
    inode.  This then calls ilookup5() to check if the corresponding VFS inode
    is in icache().  This in turn calls ifind() which waits on the inode lock
    via wait_on_inode whilst holding the global inode_lock.
    
    Process 2: pdflush results in a call to __sync_single_inode for the same
    VFS inode X on the ntfs volume.  This locks the inode (I_LOCK) then calls
    write-inode -> ntfs_write_inode -> map_mft_record() -> read_cache_page() of
    the page (in page cache of table of inodes $MFT, inode 0) containing the
    on-disk inode.  This page has PageUptodate() clear because of Process 1
    (see above) so read_cache_page() blocks when tries to take the page lock
    for the page so it can call ntfs_read_page().
    
    Thus Process 1 is holding the page lock on the page containing the on-disk
    inode X and it is waiting on the inode X to be unlocked in ifind() so it
    can write the page out and then unlock the page.
    
    And Process 2 is holding the inode lock on inode X and is waiting for the
    page to be unlocked so it can call ntfs_readpage() or discover that
    Process 1 set PageUptodate() again and use the page.
    
    Thus we have a deadlock due to ifind() waiting on the inode lock.
    
    The only sensible solution: NTFS does not care whether the VFS inode is
    locked or not when it calls ilookup5() (it doesn't use the VFS inode at
    all, it just uses it to find the corresponding ntfs_inode which is of
    course attached to the VFS inode (both are one single struct); and it uses
    the ntfs_inode which is subject to its own locking so I_LOCK is irrelevant)
    hence we want a modified ilookup5_nowait() which is the same as ilookup5()
    but it does not wait on the inode lock.
    
    Without such functionality I would have to keep my own ntfs_inode cache in
    the NTFS driver just so I can find ntfs_inodes independent of their VFS
    inodes which would be slow, memory and cpu cycle wasting, and incredibly
    stupid given the icache already exists in the VFS.
    
    Below is a patch that does the ilookup5_nowait() implementation in
    fs/inode.c and exports it.
    
    ilookup5_nowait.diff:
    
    Introduce ilookup5_nowait() which is basically the same as ilookup5() but
    it does not wait on the inode's lock (i.e. it omits the wait_on_inode()
    done in ifind()).
    
    This is needed to avoid a nasty deadlock in NTFS.

    [PATCH] fix voyager subarchitecture EXPORT_SYMBOL breakage caused by i386_ksym reduction
    
    This patch:
    
    	[PATCH] Remove i386_ksyms.c, almost
    
    made files like smp.c do their own EXPORT_SYMBOLS.  This means that all
    subarchitectures that override these symbols now have to do the exports
    themselves.  This patch adds the exports for voyager (which is the most
    affected since it has a separate smp harness).  However, someone should
    audit all the other subarchitectures to see if any others got broken.

    [PATCH] inotify
    
    inotify is intended to correct the deficiencies of dnotify, particularly
    its inability to scale and its terrible user interface:
    
            * dnotify requires the opening of one fd per each directory
              that you intend to watch. This quickly results in too many
              open files and pins removable media, preventing unmount.
            * dnotify is directory-based. You only learn about changes to
              directories. Sure, a change to a file in a directory affects
              the directory, but you are then forced to keep a cache of
              stat structures.
            * dnotify's interface to user-space is awful.  Signals?
    
    inotify provides a more usable, simple, powerful solution to file change
    notification:
    
            * inotify's interface is a system call that returns a fd, not SIGIO.
    	  You get a single fd, which is select()-able.
            * inotify has an event that says "the filesystem that the item
              you were watching is on was unmounted."
            * inotify can watch directories or files.
    
    Inotify is currently used by Beagle (a desktop search infrastructure),
    Gamin (a FAM replacement), and other projects.
    
    See Documentation/filesystems/inotify.txt.

    reiserfs: run scripts/Lindent on reiserfs code
    
    This was a pure indentation change, using:
    
    	scripts/Lindent fs/reiserfs/*.c include/linux/reiserfs_*.h
    
    to make reiserfs match the regular Linux indentation style.  As Jeff
    Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com> writes:
    
     The ReiserFS code is a mix of a number of different coding styles, sometimes
     different even from line-to-line. Since the code has been relatively stable
     for quite some time and there are few outstanding patches to be applied, it
     is time to reformat the code to conform to the Linux style standard outlined
     in Documentation/CodingStyle.
    
     This patch contains the result of running scripts/Lindent against
     fs/reiserfs/*.c and include/linux/reiserfs_*.h. There are places where the
     code can be made to look better, but I'd rather keep those patches separate
     so that there isn't a subtle by-hand hand accident in the middle of a huge
     patch. To be clear: This patch is reformatting *only*.
    
     A number of patches may follow that continue to make the code more consistent
     with the Linux coding style.
    
     Hans wasn't particularly enthusiastic about these patches, but said he
     wouldn't really oppose them either.

    [IA64] Altix pcibus_to_node implementation
    
    The Altix subarch does not provide node information via ACPI. Instead hooks
    are used to fixup pci structures. This patch determines the nodes for Altix
    PCI busses.
    
    Remote Bridges:
    ---------------
    Altix supports remote I/O nodes without memory or processors but with bridges.
    The TIOCA type of bridge is an AGP bridge and the PROM provides information
    about the closest node. That information will be returned by pcibus_to_node.
    
    The TIOCP remote bridge type is a PCI bridge but the PROM does not provide a
    closest node id. pcibus_to_node will return -1 for devices on those bridges
    meaning that device control structures may be allocated on any node.
    
    Safeguard:
    ----------
    Should the fixups result in invalid node information for a pci controller then
    a warning will be printed and pcibus_to_node will return -1.
    
    
    This patch also fixes the "FIXME" in sn_dma_alloc_coherent. This means that
    dma_alloc_coherent will now use alloc_pages_node to allocate memory local to
    the node that the PCI device is connected to.

    The following patch prevents the crash dump helper code found within kexec
    from breaking ppc which still lacks crash dump functionality.
    
    ksysfs crash_notes attribute handling was left under CONFIG_KEXEC for
    simplicity although it is not strictly kexec related.
    
    We provide here a dummy definition for crash_notes on ppc.

    [PATCH] cdev: cdev_put oops
    
    While fixing an oops in the st driver in a dirty release path, I
    encountered an oops in cdev_put for cdevs allocated using cdev_alloc.  If
    cdev_del is called when the cdev kobject still has an open user, when the
    last cdev_put is called, the cdev_put will call kobject_put, which will end
    up ultimately releasing the cdev in cdev_dynamic_release.  Patch fixes the
    oops by preventing cdev_put from accessing freed memory.

    [PATCH] reset real_timer target on exec leader change
    
    When a noninitial thread does exec, it becomes the new group leader.  If
    there is a ITIMER_REAL timer running, it points at the old group leader and
    when it fires it can follow a stale pointer.  The timer data needs to be
    reset to point at the exec'ing thread that is becoming the group leader.
    This has to synchronize with any concurrent firing of the timer to make
    sure that it_real_fn can never run when the data points to a thread that
    might have been reaped already.

    [PATCH] uml: tlb flushing fix
    
    This patch fixes a fairly serious tlb flushing bug that makes aio use under
    uml very unreliable -- SEGVs, Oops and panic()s occur as a result of stale
    tlb entires being used by uml when aio switches mms due to the fact that
    uml does not implement the activate_mm() hook.  This patch introduces a
    simple but correct approach (read: hammer) for implementing activate_mm()
    in uml by doing a force_flush_all() if the new mm is different from old.
    With this patch in place, uml is able to succeed at the aio test case that
    was randomly faulting for me before.

    [PATCH] yenta: fix parent resource determination
    
    If the CardBus windows were pre-configured and the CardBus bridge is behind a
    transparent PCI-PCI bridge, pci_find_parent_resource() might return a
    different resource than the real parent if it is called before the window is
    determined.  Therefore, move that call around.
    
    Also fix return of value in void function.

    [PATCH] bugfix: two read_inode() calls without clear_inode() call between
    
    Bug symptoms
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    For the same inode VFS calls read_inode() twice and doesn't call
    clear_inode() between the two read_inode() invocations.
    
    Bug description
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Suppose we have an inode which has zero reference count but is still in
    the inode cache. Suppose kswapd invokes shrink_icache_memory() to free
    some RAM. In prune_icache() inodes are removed from i_hash. prune_icache
    () is then going to call clear_inode(), but drops the inode_lock
    spinlock before this. If in this moment another task calls iget() for an
    inode which was just removed from i_hash by prune_icache(), then iget()
    invokes read_inode() for this inode, because it is *already removed*
    from i_hash.
    
    The end result is: we call iget(#N) then iput(#N); inode #N has zero
    i_count now and is in the inode cache; kswapd starts. kswapd removes the
    inode #N from i_hash ans is preempted; we call iget(#N) again;
    read_inode() is invoked as the result; but we expect clear_inode()
    before.
    
    Fix
    ~~~~~~~
    To fix the bug I remove inodes from i_hash later, when clear_inode() is
    actually called. I remove them from i_hash under spinlock protection.
    Since the i_state is set to I_FREEING, it is safe to do this. The others
    will sleep waiting for the inode state change.
    
    I also postpone removing inodes from i_sb_list. It is not compulsory to
    do so but I do it for readability reasons. Inodes are added/removed to
    the lists together everywhere in the code and there is no point to
    change this rule. This is harmless because the only user of i_sb_list
    which somehow may interfere with me (invalidate_list()) is excluded by
    the iprune_sem mutex.
    
    The same race is possible in invalidate_list() so I do the same for it.

    [PATCH] __wait_on_freeing_inode fix
    
    This patch fixes queer behavior in __wait_on_freeing_inode().
    
    If I_LOCK was not set it called yield(), effectively busy waiting for the
    removal of the inode from the hash.  This change was introduced within
    "[PATCH] eliminate inode waitqueue hashtable" Changeset 1.1938.166.16 last
    october by wli.
    
    The solution is to restore the old behavior, of unconditionally waiting on
    the waitqueue.  It doesn't matter if I_LOCK is not set initally, the task
    will go to sleep, and wake up when wake_up_inode() is called from
    generic_delete_inode() after removing the inode from the hash chain.
    
    Comment is also updated to better reflect current behavior.
    
    This condition is very hard to trigger normally (simultaneous clear_inode()
    with iget()) so probably only heavy stress testing can reveal any change of
    behavior.

    [VLAN]: Fix early vlan adding leads to not functional device
    
    OK, I can see what's happening here. eth0 doesn't detect link-up until
    after a few seconds, so when the vlan interface is opened immediately
    after eth0 has been opened, it inherits the link-down state. Subsequently
    the vlan interface is never properly activated and are thus unable to
    transmit any packets.
    
    dev->state bits are not supposed to be manipulated directly. Something
    similar is probably needed for the netif_device_present() bit, although
    I don't know how this is meant to work for a virtual device.

    [PATCH] USB: add ldusb driver
    
    The following driver provides complete interrupt-in and interrupt-out
    reports (raw data) to a user program. Until now it uses the
    HIDIOCGDEVINFO ioctl call, because I don't know better :-(. Perhaps, it
    will be ok for you - and I will be happy, if you assign 8 minor numbers.
    
    I have tested it in several environments and it works very well for me.
    However, it has a problem with two or more devices at the same hub, if
    the two or more devices need 1 ms interrupt-in transfers. Unfortunately
    more than one interrupt-in transfer every ms isn't possible (ehci
    driver?). This is why the min_interrupt_in_interval and
    min_interrupt_out_interval are increased to 2 ms (see the corresponding
    module parameters). This way, I can use two devices simultaneously at
    the same hub.

    [PATCH] USB: coverity: (desc->bitmap)[] overrun fix
    
    The length of the array desc->bitmap is 3, and not 4:
    
    Definitions involved:
    
    In drivers/usb/core/hcd.h
    
    464  	#define bitmap 	DeviceRemovable
    
    In drivers/usb/host/ohci-hub.c
    
    395  		struct usb_hub_descriptor	*desc
    
    In drivers/usb/core/hub.h
    
    130  	struct usb_hub_descriptor {
    131  		__u8  bDescLength;
    132  		__u8  bDescriptorType;
    133  		__u8  bNbrPorts;
    134  		__u16 wHubCharacteristics;
    135  		__u8  bPwrOn2PwrGood;
    136  		__u8  bHubContrCurrent;
    137  		    	/* add 1 bit for hub status change; round to bytes */
    138  		__u8  DeviceRemovable[(USB_MAXCHILDREN + 1 + 7) / 8];
    139  		__u8  PortPwrCtrlMask[(USB_MAXCHILDREN + 1 + 7) / 8];
    140  	} __attribute__ ((packed));
    
    In include/linux/usb.h
    
    306  	#define USB_MAXCHILDREN		(16)
    
    This defect was found automatically by Coverity Prevent, a static analysis
    tool.
    
    (akpm: this code should be shot.  Field `bitmap' doesn't exist in struct
    usb_hub_descriptor.  And this .c file is #included in
    drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.c, and someone somewhere #defines `bitmap' to
    `DeviceRemovable'.
    
    >From a maintainability POV it would be better to memset the whole array
    beforehand - I changed the patch to do that)

    [PATCH] USB: add driver for Keyspan Digital Remote
    
    This driver is a basic keypress input driver for the Keyspan Digital
    Remote with part number UIA-11.  Currently there is an older remote with
    part number UIA-10 which isn't supported by this driver.  Support for
    the older UIA-10 could be added but a binary file is required to be
    download to the device, and I don't have that file.  I also don't have a
    UIA-10 device so I wouldn't be able to test any of the changes.

    Make usbmon to print Setup packets of Control transfers. This is useful
    when debugging enumeration issues.
    
    This is a change to the trace format which is not fully compatible.
    A parser has to look at the data length word now. If that word is
    a character like 's', read setup packet before proceeding with data.
    I decided not to bump the API tag for this because not many such
    parsers exist at this point.

    [PATCH] USB ATM: fix line resync logic
    
    We map states 0x00 and 0x10 to the ATM_PHY_SIG_LOST flag.  The current logic fails to
    resync the line if we get state 0x10 followed by 0x00, since we only resync the line
    when the state is 0x00 and the flag changed.  Doubly fixed by (1) always resyncing the
    line when the state is 0x00 even if the state didn't change, and (2) keeping track of
    the last state, not just the flag.  We do (2) as well as (1) in order to get better log
    messages.
    
    This is a tweaked version of the original patch by Aurelio Arroyo.

    node a certain pcibus connects to. Allocations of control structures
    for devices can then be made on the node where the pci bus is located
    to allow local access during interrupt and other device manipulation.
    
    This patch provides a new "node" field in the the pci_controller

    [NET]: move config options out to individual protocols
    
    Move the protocol specific config options out to the specific protocols.
    With this change net/Kconfig now starts to become readable and serve as a
    good basis for further re-structuring.
    
    The menu structure is left almost intact, except that indention is
    fixed in most cases. Most visible are the INET changes where several
    "depends on INET" are replaced with a single ifdef INET / endif pair.
    
    Several new files were created to accomplish this change - they are
    small but serve the purpose that config options are now distributed
    out where they belongs.

    ACPICA 20050408 from Bob Moore
    
    Fixed three cases in the interpreter where an "index"
    argument to an ASL function was still (internally) 32
    bits instead of the required 64 bits.  This was the Index
    argument to the Index, Mid, and Match operators.
    
    The "strupr" function is now permanently local
    (acpi_ut_strupr), since this is not a POSIX-defined
    function and not present in most kernel-level C
    libraries. References to the C library strupr function
    have been removed from the headers.
    
    Completed the deployment of static
    functions/prototypes. All prototypes with the static
    attribute have been moved from the headers to the owning
    C file.
    
    ACPICA 20050329 from Bob Moore
    
    An error is now generated if an attempt is made to create
    a Buffer Field of length zero (A CreateField with a length
    operand of zero.)
    
    The interpreter now issues a warning whenever executable
    code at the module level is detected during ACPI table
    load. This will give some idea of the prevalence of this
    type of code.
    
    Implemented support for references to named objects (other
    than control methods) within package objects.
    
    Enhanced package object output for the debug
    object. Package objects are now completely dumped, showing
    all elements.
    
    Enhanced miscellaneous object output for the debug
    object. Any object can now be written to the debug object
    (for example, a device object can be written, and the type
    of the object will be displayed.)
    
    The "static" qualifier has been added to all local
    functions across the core subsystem.
    
    The number of "long" lines (> 80 chars) within the source
    has been significantly reduced, by about 1/3.
    
    Cleaned up all header files to ensure that all CA/iASL
    functions are prototyped (even static functions) and the
    formatting is consistent.
    
    Two new header files have been added, acopcode.h and
    acnames.h.
    
    Removed several obsolete functions that were no longer
    used.

    Device drivers for ordinary NIC's are still to be found

    [IPV4]: Prevent oops when printing martian source
    
    In some cases, we may be generating packets with a source address that
    qualifies as martian. This can happen when we're in the middle of setting
    up the network, and netfilter decides to reject a packet with an RST.
    The IPv4 routing code would try to print a warning and oops, because
    locally generated packets do not have a valid skb->mac.raw pointer
    at this point.

    - ip_vs_random_dropentry now runs in process context and should use _bh

    [ACPI] Bind PCI devices with ACPI devices
    
    Implement the framework for binding physical devices
    with ACPI devices. A physical bus like PCI bus
    should create a 'acpi_bus_type', with:
    
    .find_device:
            For device which has parent such as normal PCI devices.
    
    .find_bridge:
            It's for special devices, such as PCI root bridge
    	or IDE controller.  Such devices generally haven't a
    	parent or ->bus. We use the special method
    	to get an ACPI handle.
    
    Uses new field in struct device: firmware_data

    [PATCH] I2C: minor I2C doc cleanups
    
    The I2C stack has long had "id" fields, of rather dubious utility, in
    many data structures.  This removes mention of one of them from the
    documentation about how to write an I2C driver, so that only drivers
    that really need to use them (probably old/legacy code) will have any
    reason to use this field.

    [PATCH] I2C: New max6875 driver may corrupt EEPROMs
    
    After a careful code analysis on the new max6875 driver
    (drivers/i2c/chips/max6875.c), I have come to the conclusion that this
    driver may cause EEPROM corruptions if used on random systems.
    
    The EEPROM part of the MAX6875 chip is accessed using rather uncommon
    I2C sequences. What is seen by the MAX6875 as reads can be seen by a
    standard EEPROM (24C02) as writes. If you check the detection method
    used by the driver, you'll find that the first SMBus command it will
    send on the bus is i2c_smbus_write_byte_data(client, 0x80, 0x40). For
    the MAX6875 it makes an internal pointer point to a specific offset of
    the EEPROM waiting for a subsequent read command, so it's not an actual
    data write operation, but for a standard EEPROM, this instead means
    writing value 0x40 to offset 0x80. Blame Philips and Intel for the
    obscure protocol.
    
    Since the MAX6875 and the standard, common 24C02 EEPROMs share two I2C
    addresses (0x50 and 0x52), loading the max6875 driver on a system with
    standard EEPROMs at either address will trigger a write on these
    EEPROMs, which will lead to their corruption if they happen not to be
    write protected. This kind of EEPROMs can be found on memory modules
    (SPD), ethernet adapters (MAC address), laptops (proprietary data) and
    displays (EDID/DDC). Most of these are hopefully write-protected, but
    not all of them.
    
    For this reason, I would recommend that the max6875 driver be
    neutralized, in a way that nobody can corrupt his/her EEPROMs by just
    loading the driver. This means either deleting the driver completely, or
    not listing any default address for it. I'd like this to be done before
    2.6.13-rc1 is released.
    
    Additionally, the max6875 driver lacks the 24RF08 corruption preventer
    present in the eeprom driver, which means that loading this driver in a
    system with such a chip would corrupt it as well.
    
    Here is a proposed quick patch addressing the issue, although I wouldn't
    mind a complete removal if it makes everyone feel safer. I think Ben
    has plans to replace this driver by a much simplified one anyway.

    [IA64] assign_irq_vector() should not panic
    
    Current assign_irq_vector() will panic if interrupt vectors is running
    out. But I think how to handle the case of lack of interrupt vectors
    should be handled by the caller of this function. For example, some
    PCI devices can raise the interrupt signal via both MSI and I/O
    APIC. So even if the driver for these device fails to allocate a
    vector for MSI, the driver still has a chance to use I/O APIC based
    interrupt. But currently there is no chance for these driver to use
    I/O APIC based interrupt because kernel will panic when
    assign_irq_vector() fails to allocate interrupt vector.
    
    The following patch changes assign_irq_vector() for ia64 to return
    -ENOSPC on error instead of panic (as i386 and x86_64 versions do).

    Input: HID - only report events coming from interrupts to hiddev
    
    Currently hid-core follows the same code path for input reports
    regardless of whether they are a result of interrupt transfers or
    control transfers. That leads to interrupt events erroneously being
    reported to hiddev for regular control transfers.
    
    Prior to 2.6.12 the problem was mitigated by the fact that
    reporting to hiddev is supressed if the field value has not changed,
    which is often the case. Said filtering was removed in 2.6.12-rc1 which
    means any input reports fetched via control transfers result in hiddev
    interrupt events. This behavior can quickly lead to a feedback loop
    where a userspace app, in response to interrupt events, issues control
    transfers which in turn create more interrupt events.
    
    This patch prevents input reports that arrive via control transfers from
    being reported to hiddev as interrupt events.

    Toshiba Dynabooks require the same workaround as Satellites -
    Synaptics report rate should be lowered to 40pps (from 80),
    otherwise KBC starts losing keypresses.

    [PATCH] Sync up ieee-1394
    
    Lots of this patch is trivial code cleanups (static vars were being
    intialized to 0, etc).
    
    There's also some fixes for ISO transmits (max buffer handling).
    Aswell, we have a few fixes to disable IRM capabilites correctly.  We've
    also disabled, by default some generally unused EXPORT symbols for the
    sake of cleanliness in the kernel.  However, instead of removing them
    completely, we felt it necessary to have a config option that allowed
    them to be enabled for the many projects outside of the main kernel tree
    that use our API for driver development.
    
    The primary reason for this patch is to revert a MODE6->MODE10 RBC
    conversion patch from the SCSI maintainers.  The new conversions handled
    directly in the scsi layer do not seem to work for SBP2.  This patch
    reverts to our old working code so that users can enjoy using Firewire
    disks and dvd drives again.
    
    We are working with the SCSI maintainers to resolve this issue outside
    of the main kernel tree.  We'll merge the patch once the SCSI layer's
    handling of the MODE10 conversion is working for us.

    1) In the full-state API when imsf_numsrc == 0
       errno should be "0", but returns EADDRNOTAVAIL
    
    2) An illegal filter mode change
       errno should be EINVAL, but returns EADDRNOTAVAIL
    
    3) Trying to do an any-source option without IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP
       errno should be EINVAL, but returns EADDRNOTAVAIL
    
    4) Adds comments for the less obvious error return values

    [IPV4]: multicast API "join" issues
    
    1) Changes IP_ADD_SOURCE_MEMBERSHIP and MCAST_JOIN_SOURCE_GROUP to ignore
       EADDRINUSE errors on a "courtesy join" -- prior membership or not
       is ok for these.
    
    2) Adds "leave group" equivalence of (INCLUDE, empty) filters in the
       delta-based API. Without this, mixing delta-based API calls that
       end in an (INCLUDE, empty) filter would not allow a subsequent
       regular IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP. It also frees socket buffer memory that
       isn't needed for both the multicast group record and source filter.

    [IPV4]: multicast API "join" issues
    
            This patch corrects a few problems with the IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP
    socket option:
    
    1) The existing code makes an attempt at reference counting joins when
       using the ip_mreqn/imr_ifindex interface. Joining the same group
       on the same socket is an error, whatever the API. This leads to
       unexpected results when mixing ip_mreqn by index with ip_mreqn by
       address, ip_mreq, or other API's. For example, ip_mreq followed by
       ip_mreqn of the same group will "work" while the same two reversed
       will not.
               Fixed to always return EADDRINUSE on a duplicate join and
       removed the (now unused) reference count in ip_mc_socklist.
    
    2) The group-search list in ip_mc_join_group() is comparing a full
       ip_mreqn structure and all of it must match for it to find the
       group. This doesn't correctly match a group that was joined with
       ip_mreq or ip_mreqn with an address (with or without an index). It
       also doesn't match groups that are joined by different addresses on
       the same interface. All of these are the same multicast group,
       which is identified by group address and interface index.
               Fixed the check to correctly match groups so we don't get
       duplicate group entries on the ip_mc_socklist.
    
    3) The old code allocates a multicast address before searching for
       duplicates requiring it to free in various error cases. This
       patch moves the allocate until after the search and
       igmp_max_memberships check, so never a need to allocate, then free
       an entry.

    [NET]: Transform skb_queue_len() binary tests into skb_queue_empty()
    
    This is part of the grand scheme to eliminate the qlen
    member of skb_queue_head, and subsequently remove the
    'list' member of sk_buff.
    
    Most users of skb_queue_len() want to know if the queue is
    empty or not, and that's trivially done with skb_queue_empty()
    which doesn't use the skb_queue_head->qlen member and instead
    uses the queue list emptyness as the test.

    [PATCH] nfsd4: relax new lock seqid check
    
    We're insisting that the lock sequence id field passed in the
    open_to_lockowner struct always be zero.  This is probably thanks to the
    sentence in rfc3530: "The first request issued for any given lock_owner is
    issued with a sequence number of zero."
    
    But there doesn't seem to be any problem with allowing initial sequence
    numbers other than zero.  And currently this is causing lock reclaims from the
    Linux client to fail.
    
    In the spirit of "be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you
    send", we'll relax the check (and patch the Linux client as well).

    [PATCH] nfsd4: fix open_reclaim seqid
    
    The sequence number we store in the sequence id is the last one we received
    from the client.  So on the next operation we'll check that the client gives
    us the next higher number.
    
    We increment sequence id's at the last moment, in encode, so that we're sure
    of knowing the right error return.  (The decision to increment the sequence id
    depends on the exact error returned.)
    
    However on the *first* use of a sequence number, if we set the sequence number
    to the one received from the client and then let the increment happen on
    encode, we'll be left with a sequence number one to high.
    
    For that reason, ENCODE_SEQID_OP_TAIL only increments the sequence id on
    *confirmed* stateowners.
    
    This creates a problem for open reclaims, which are confirmed on first use.
    Therefore the open reclaim code, as a special exception, *decrements* the
    sequence id, cancelling out the undesired increment on encode.  But this
    prevents the sequence id from ever being incremented in the case where
    multiple reclaims are sent with the same openowner.  Yuch!
    
    We could add another exception to the open reclaim code, decrementing the
    sequence id only if this is the first use of the open owner.
    
    But it's simpler by far to modify the meaning of the op_seqid field: instead
    of representing the previous value sent by the client, we take op_seqid, after
    encoding, to represent the *next* sequence id that we expect from the client.
    This eliminates the need for special-case handling of the first use of a
    stateowner.

    [PATCH] nfsd4: stop overusing RECLAIM_BAD
    
    A misreading of the spec lead us to convert all errors on open and lock
    reclaims to RECLAIM_BAD.  This causes problems--for example, a reboot within
    the grace period could lead to reclaims with stale stateid's, and we'd like to
    return STALE errors in those cases.
    
    What rfc3530 actually says about RECLAIM_BAD: "The reclaim provided by the
    client does not match any of the server's state consistency checks and is
    bad." I'm assuming that "state consistency checks" refers to checks for
    consistency with the state recorded to stable storage, and that the error
    should be reserved for that case.

    One correction is needed.  Changes are not needed for

    compatibility part, which is never used in 2.6 kernels.  The only right
    thing we could to that compatibility code would be to remove it throughout

    [PATCH] pcmcia: remove client services version
    
    The Linux PCMCIA code has some data that was apparently used (or meant to be
    used) to ensure that only proper client drivers are loaded.  This is now
    ensured (to a certain degree) by the fact that the most client drivers are
    part of the kernel.  Also, the version information has not been updated
    despite major changes in PCMCIA API.  This has made it meaningless.
    
    This patch removes servinfo_t and pcmcia_get_card_services_info.  They are not
    used in any userspace utilities such as pcmcia-cs and pcmciautils.
    drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia_ioctl.c is adjusted accordingly.
    
    CS_RELEASE and CS_RELEASE_CODE are removed.  include/pcmcia/version.h is empty
    now.  It will be removed later, but for now it's left in the tree to avoid
    touching all PCMCIA clients.
    
    The only driver that needs to be changed is drivers/scsi/pcmcia/nsp_cs.c,
    which uses CS_RELEASE_CODE.

    [PATCH] pcmcia: fix i82365 request_region double usage
    
    http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=f354942cb301fed273f423fb5c4f57bde3efc5b2
    converted the check_region() calls in drivers/pcmcia/i82365.c into
    request_regions.  Unfortunately this seems to have broken things.
    
    isa_probe() used to call check_region() and then call add_pcic() which would
    request_region().
    
    Now isa_probe() calls request_region() and then calls add_pcic() which calls
    request_region() again, this fails and add_pcic() returns immediately without
    doing all the setup etc.
    
    On the face of it the patch below fixes the problem, by not doing the second
    request region in add_pcic().  I think this is preferable to remove the call
    in isa_probe() since identify() touches the I/O regions and is called before
    add_pcic().
    
    However I haven't fully grokked the meaning of the code which follows the
    request_region() in isa_probe(), so I'm not sure that the handling WRT
    multiple sockets and multiple bridge chips is correct.  In particular I'm not
    convinced that the regions for subsequent sockets and/or bridges will be
    requested at all.  I suspect a more thorough reworking by someone who
    understands what is going on there might be in order.
    
    I should mention that I'm actually messing about with this on an ARM platform
    with wacky memory and i/o mapping offsets etc, it doesn't quite work yet for
    other reasons which preclude full testing etc, but I think the problem above
    is still present for more normal x86 stuff.

    [PATCH] dvb: usb/pci: correct syntax of driver name fields
    
    Change the name-field of the pci_driver and usb_driver structs to the name of
    the module after compilation.  It seems that this field is used in some places
    where special characters are not allowed.  Thanks to Alan Halverson for
    finding this problem.

    o Make the frequency setting card specific
    o Make the bandwidth setting generic such that it supports more DVB-T cards
    o Set QAM size for DVB-C cards that do not autodetect QAM size
    o Fix a bug that caused the polarization not to be set.
      Set polarization for cards that do not autodetect polarization
    o Fix a bogus frontend signal lock, that caused a tuning delay as well.

    [PATCH] dvb: flexcop: woraround irq stop problem
    
    The flexcop chip often stops generating interrupts after some hours of
    operation.  Apparently this can be fixed by resetting register block 0x300 at
    each channel change (this is not detailed in the flexcop data books).
    
    This patch also restructures DMA handling and adds a bit of debug code for the
    irq problem in case it still happens for someone.

    [PATCH] set mnt_namespace in the correct place
    
    This patch sets ->mnt_namespace where it's actually added to the
    namespace.
    
    Previously mnt_namespace was set in do_kern_mount() even if the filesystem
    was never added to any process's namespace (most kernel-internal
    filesystems).
    
    This discrepancy doesn't actually cause any problems, but it's cleaner if
    mnt_namespace is NULL for these non exported filesystems.

    [PATCH] namespace.c: fix mnt_namespace zeroing for expired mounts
    
    This patch clears mnt_namespace in an expired mount.
    
    If mnt_namespace is not cleared, it's possible to attach a new mount to the
    already detached mount, because check_mnt() can return true.
    
    The effect is a resource leak, since the resulting tree will never be
    freed.

    [PATCH] namespace.c: fix expiring of detached mount
    
    This patch fixes a bug noticed by Al Viro:
    
       However, we still have a problem here - just what would
       happen if vfsmount is detached while we were grabbing namespace
       semaphore?  Refcount alone is not useful here - we might be held by
       whoever had detached the vfsmount.  IOW, we should check that it's
       still attached (i.e. that mnt->mnt_parent != mnt).  If it's not -
       just leave it alone, do mntput() and let whoever holds it deal with
       the sucker.  No need to put it back on lists.

    [PATCH] namespace.c: cleanup in mark_mounts_for_expiry()
    
    This patch simplifies mark_mounts_for_expiry() by using detach_mnt() instead
    of duplicating everything it does.
    
    It should be an equivalent transformation except for righting the dput/mntput
    order.
    
    Al Viro said: "Looks sane".

    [PATCH] namespace.c: fix race in mark_mounts_for_expiry()
    
    This patch fixes a race found by Ram in mark_mounts_for_expiry() in
    fs/namespace.c.
    
    The bug can only be triggered with simultaneous exiting of a process having
    a private namespace, and expiry of a mount from within that namespace.
    It's practically impossible to trigger, and I haven't even tried.  But
    still, a bug is a bug.
    
    The race happens when put_namespace() is called by another task, while
    mark_mounts_for_expiry() is between atomic_read() and get_namespace().  In
    that case get_namespace() will be called on an already dead namespace with
    unforeseeable results.
    
    The solution was suggested by Al Viro, with his own words:
    
          Instead of screwing with atomic_read() in there, why don't we
          simply do the following:
          	a) atomic_dec_and_lock() in put_namespace()
          	b) __put_namespace() called without dropping lock
          	c) the first thing done by __put_namespace would be
          struct vfsmount *root = namespace->root;
          namespace->root = NULL;
          spin_unlock(...);
          ....
          umount_tree(root);
          ...
          	d) check in mark_... would be simply namespace && namespace->root.
    
          And we are all set; no screwing around with atomic_read(), no magic
          at all.  Dying namespace gets NULL ->root.
          All changes of ->root happen under spinlock.
          If under a spinlock we see non-NULL ->mnt_namespace, it won't be
          freed until we drop the lock (we will set ->mnt_namespace to NULL
          under that lock before we get to freeing namespace).
          If under a spinlock we see non-NULL ->mnt_namespace and
          ->mnt_namespace->root, we can grab a reference to namespace and be
          sure that it won't go away.

    [PATCH] namespace.c: fix mnt_namespace clearing
    
    This patch clears mnt_namespace on unmount.
    
    Not clearing mnt_namespace has two effects:
    
       1) It is possible to attach a new mount to a detached mount,
          because check_mnt() returns true.
    
          This means, that when no other references to the detached mount
          remain, it still can't be freed.  This causes a resource leak,
          and possibly un-removable modules.
    
       2) If mnt_namespace is dereferenced (only in mark_mounts_for_expiry())
          after the namspace has been freed, it can cause an Oops, memory
          corruption, etc.
    
    1) has been tested before and after the patch, 2) is only speculation.

    [PATCH] IB uverbs: core API extensions
    
    First of a series of patches which add support for direct userspace access to
    InfiniBand hardware -- so-called "userspace verbs." I believe these patches
    are ready to merge, but a final review would be useful.
    
    These patches should incorporate all of the feedback from the discussion when
    I posted an earlier version back in April (see
    http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/4/267 for the start of the thread).  In
    particular, memory pinned for use by userspace is accounted for in
    current->mm->vm_locked and requests to pin memory are checked against
    RLIMIT_MEMLOCK.
    
    This patch:
    
    Modify the ib_verbs.h header file with changes required for InfiniBand
    userspace verbs support.  We add a few structures to keep track of userspace
    context, and extend the driver API so that low-level drivers know when they're
    creating resources that will be used from userspace.

    [PATCH] mostly_read data section
    
    Add a new section called ".data.read_mostly" for data items that are read
    frequently and rarely written to like cpumaps etc.
    
    If these maps are placed in the .data section then these frequenly read
    items may end up in cachelines with data is is frequently updated.  In that
    case all processors in an SMP system must needlessly reload the cachelines
    again and again containing elements of those frequently used variables.
    
    The ability to share these cachelines will allow each cpu in an SMP system
    to keep local copies of those shared cachelines thereby optimizing

    [PATCH] tty output lossage fix
    
    The patch fixes a few corner cases around tty line editing with
    very long input lines:
    
    - n_tty_receive_char(): don't simply drop eol characters,
      otherwise canon_data isn't increased and the reader isn't woken
      up.
    
    - n_tty_receive_room(): If there is no newline pending and the
      edit buffer is full, allow only a single character to be written
      (until eol is found and the line is flushed), so characters from
      the next line aren't dropped.
    
    - write_chan(): if an incomplete line was written, continue
      writing until write() returns 0, otherwise it might not write
      the eol character to flush the line and the writer goes to sleep
      without ever being woken up.
    
    BTW the core problem is that part of this should be handled in the
    receive_buf path, but for this it has to return the number of
    written characters, as the amount of written characters may not be
    the same as the amount of characters going into the write buffer,
    so the receive_room() usage in pty_write() is not really reliable.
    
    Alan said:
    
    The problem looks valid. The behaviour of 'traditional unix' appears to
    be the following
    
    	If you exceed the line limit then beep and drop the character
    	Always allow EOL to complete a canonical line input
    	Always do signal/control processing if enabled

    [PATCH] xtensa: remove old syscalls
    
    xtensa is now in -rc1, with the obsolete syscalls still in there, so I
    guess this about the last chance to correct the ABI.  Applying the patch
    obviously breaks all sorts of user space binaries and probably also
    requires the appropriate changes to be made to libc.
    
    On the other hand, if a decision is made to keep the broken interface, it
    should at least be a conscious one instead of an oversight.

    [PATCH] uml: Proper clone support for skas0
    
    This patch implements the clone-stub mechanism, which allows skas0 to run
    with proc_mm==0, even if the clib in UML uses modify_ldt.
    
    Note: There is a bug in skas3.v7 host patch, that avoids UML-skas from
    running properly on a SMP-box.  In full skas3, I never really saw problems,
    but in skas0 they showed up.
    
    More commentary by jdike - What this patch does is makes sure that the host
    parent of each new host process matches the UML parent of the corresponding
    UML process.  This ensures that any changed LDTs are inherited.  This is
    done by having clone actually called by the UML process from its stub,
    rather than by the kernel.  We have special syscall stubs that are loaded
    onto the stub code page because that code must be completely
    self-contained.  These stubs are given C interfaces, and used like normal C
    functions, but there are subtleties.  Principally, we have to be careful
    about stack variables in stub_clone_handler after the clone.  The code is
    written so that there aren't any - everything boils down to a fixed
    address.  If there were any locals, references to them after the clone
    would be wrong because the stack just changed.

    [PATCH] uml: skas0 - separate kernel address space on stock hosts
    
    UML has had two modes of operation - an insecure, slow mode (tt mode) in
    which the kernel is mapped into every process address space which requires
    no host kernel modifications, and a secure, faster mode (skas mode) in
    which the UML kernel is in a separate host address space, which requires a
    patch to the host kernel.
    
    This patch implements something very close to skas mode for hosts which
    don't support skas - I'm calling this skas0.  It provides the security of
    the skas host patch, and some of the performance gains.
    
    The two main things that are provided by the skas patch, /proc/mm and
    PTRACE_FAULTINFO, are implemented in a way that require no host patch.
    
    For the remote address space changing stuff (mmap, munmap, and mprotect),
    we set aside two pages in the process above its stack, one of which
    contains a little bit of code which can call mmap et al.
    
    To update the address space, the system call information (system call
    number and arguments) are written to the stub page above the code.  The
    %esp is set to the beginning of the data, the %eip is set the the start of
    the stub, and it repeatedly pops the information into its registers and
    makes the system call until it sees a system call number of zero.  This is
    to amortize the cost of the context switch across multiple address space
    updates.
    
    When the updates are done, it SIGSTOPs itself, and the kernel process
    continues what it was doing.
    
    For a PTRACE_FAULTINFO replacement, we set up a SIGSEGV handler in the
    child, and let it handle segfaults rather than nullifying them.  The
    handler is in the same page as the mmap stub.  The second page is used as
    the stack.  The handler reads cr2 and err from the sigcontext, sticks them
    at the base of the stack in a faultinfo struct, and SIGSTOPs itself.  The
    kernel then reads the faultinfo and handles the fault.
    
    A complication on x86_64 is that this involves resetting the registers to
    the segfault values when the process is inside the kill system call.  This
    breaks on x86_64 because %rcx will contain %rip because you tell SYSRET
    where to return to by putting the value in %rcx.  So, this corrupts $rcx on
    return from the segfault.  To work around this, I added an
    arch_finish_segv, which on x86 does nothing, but which on x86_64 ptraces
    the child back through the sigreturn.  This causes %rcx to be restored by
    sigreturn and avoids the corruption.  Ultimately, I think I will replace
    this with the trick of having it send itself a blocked signal which will be
    unblocked by the sigreturn.  This will allow it to be stopped just after
    the sigreturn, and PTRACE_SYSCALLed without all the back-and-forth of
    PTRACE_SYSCALLing it through sigreturn.
    
    This runs on a stock host, so theoretically (and hopefully), tt mode isn't
    needed any more.  We need to make sure that this is better in every way
    than tt mode, though.  I'm concerned about the speed of address space
    updates and page fault handling, since they involve extra round-trips to
    the child.  We can amortize the round-trip cost for large address space
    updates by writing all of the operations to the data page and having the
    child execute them all at the same time.  This will help fork and exec, but
    not page faults, since they involve only one page.
    
    I can't think of any way to help page faults, except to add something like
    PTRACE_FAULTINFO to the host.  There is PTRACE_SIGINFO, but UML doesn't use
    siginfo for SIGSEGV (or anything else) because there isn't enough
    information in the siginfo struct to handle page faults (the faulting
    operation type is missing).  Adding that would make PTRACE_SIGINFO a usable
    equivalent to PTRACE_FAULTINFO.
    
    As for the code itself:
    
    - The system call stub is in arch/um/kernel/sys-$(SUBARCH)/stub.S.  It is
      put in its own section of the binary along with stub_segv_handler in
      arch/um/kernel/skas/process.c.  This is manipulated with run_syscall_stub
      in arch/um/kernel/skas/mem_user.c.  syscall_stub will execute any system
      call at all, but it's only used for mmap, munmap, and mprotect.
    
    - The x86_64 stub calls sigreturn by hand rather than allowing the normal
      sigreturn to happen, because the normal sigreturn is a SA_RESTORER in
      UML's address space provided by libc.  Needless to say, this is not
      available in the child's address space.  Also, it does a couple of odd
      pops before that which restore the stack to the state it was in at the
      time the signal handler was called.
    
    - There is a new field in the arch mmu_context, which is now a union.
      This is the pid to be manipulated rather than the /proc/mm file
      descriptor.  Code which deals with this now checks proc_mm to see whether
      it should use the usual skas code or the new code.
    
    - userspace_tramp is now used to create a new host process for every UML
      process, rather than one per UML processor.  It checks proc_mm and
      ptrace_faultinfo to decide whether to map in the pages above its stack.
    
    - start_userspace now makes CLONE_VM conditional on proc_mm since we need
      separate address spaces now.
    
    - switch_mm_skas now just sets userspace_pid[0] to the new pid rather
      than PTRACE_SWITCH_MM.  There is an addition to userspace which updates
      its idea of the pid being manipulated each time around the loop.  This is
      important on exec, when the pid will change underneath userspace().
    
    - The stub page has a pte, but it can't be mapped in using tlb_flush
      because it is part of tlb_flush.  This is why it's required for it to be
      mapped in by userspace_tramp.
    
    Other random things:
    
    - The stub section in uml.lds.S is page aligned.  This page is written
      out to the backing vm file in setup_physmem because it is mapped from
      there into user processes.
    
    - There's some confusion with TASK_SIZE now that there are a couple of
      extra pages that the process can't use.  TASK_SIZE is considered by the
      elf code to be the usable process memory, which is reasonable, so it is
      decreased by two pages.  This confuses the definition of
      USER_PGDS_IN_LAST_PML4, making it too small because of the rounding down
      of the uneven division.  So we round it to the nearest PGDIR_SIZE rather
      than the lower one.
    
    - I added a missing PT_SYSCALL_ARG6_OFFSET macro.
    
    - um_mmu.h was made into a userspace-usable file.
    
    - proc_mm and ptrace_faultinfo are globals which say whether the host
      supports these features.
    
    - There is a bad interaction between the mm.nr_ptes check at the end of
      exit_mmap, stack randomization, and skas0.  exit_mmap will stop freeing
      pages at the PGDIR_SIZE boundary after the last vma.  If the stack isn't
      on the last page table page, the last pte page won't be freed, as it
      should be since the stub ptes are there, and exit_mmap will BUG because
      there is an unfreed page.  To get around this, TASK_SIZE is set to the
      next lowest PGDIR_SIZE boundary and mm->nr_ptes is decremented after the
      calls to init_stub_pte.  This ensures that we know the process stack (and
      all other process mappings) will be below the top page table page, and
      thus we know that mm->nr_ptes will be one too many, and can be
      decremented.
    
    Things that need fixing:
    
    - We may need better assurrences that the stub code is PIC.
    
    - The stub pte is set up in init_new_context_skas.
    
    - alloc_pgdir is probably the right place.

    Not sure if we really need this, but it was handy to know which iSeries loop I
    was testing.
    
    Be consistent about printing which idle loop we're using, with this patch we
    cover all cases.

    - separate shared and dedicated idle loops
    - check need_resched again with irqs off to avoid sleeping with pending work
    - continually set runlatch off in idle loop, this means we dont need to
      turn the runlatch off on exception exit and suffer that associated
      cost for all exceptions. (A future patch will turn the runlatch on at
      exception entry)

    [PATCH] hvc_console: Rearrange code
    
    Milton Miller has done a lot of work to clean up our hvc_console code.
    
    One of the important things the following patch series does is separate the
    VIO layer from the hvc_console code.  With the VIO specific code removed any
    ppc64 platform, or even any architecture, can use hvc_console as a generic
    polling console.  You simply have to supply a get_chars and put_chars method
    and hvc_console does the rest of the work.  You can even use it for an
    interrupt driven console.
    
    This patch:
    
    Rearrange the code in drivers/char/hvc_console.c to make future patches
    smaller.  No actual code changes, just ordering of the functions in the file.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Turn runlatch on in exception entry
    
    Enable the runlatch at the start of each exception.  Unfortunately we are out
    of space in the 0x300 handler, so I added it a bit later.
    
    The SPR write is fairly expensive, perhaps we should cache the runlatch state
    in the paca and avoid the write when possible.
    
    We don't need to turn the runlatch off, we do that in the idle loop.  Better
    to take the hit in the idle loop than for each exception exit.

    [PATCH] kbuild: build a single module using 'make dir/module.ko'
    
    Using the syntax:
    make dir/module.ko
    
    kbuild now allows one to build a module including the final link stage.
    This is usefull when one only wants to compile a single module and thus do
    not have to wait until a full kernel has finished compiling.  Tested by:

    [PATCH] mm: quieten OOM killer noise
    
    We now print statistics when invoking the OOM killer, however this
    information is not rate limited and you can get into situations where the
    console is continually spammed.
    
    For example, when a task is exiting the OOM killer will simply return
    (waiting for that task to exit and clear up memory).  If the VM continually
    calls back into the OOM killer we get thousands of copies of show_mem() on
    the console.
    
    Use printk_ratelimit() to quieten it.

    [PATCH] export generic_drop_inode() to modules
    
    OCFS2 wants to mark an inode which has been orphaned by another node so
    that during final iput it takes the correct path through the VFS and can
    pass through the OCFS2 delete_inode callback.  Since i_nlink can get out of
    date with other nodes, the best way I see to accomplish this is by clearing
    i_nlink on those inodes at drop_inode time.  Other than this small amount
    of work, nothing different needs to happen, so I think it would be cleanest
    to be able to just call generic_drop_inode at the end of the OCFS2
    drop_inode callback.

    [IA64] fix generic/up builds
    
    Jesse Barnes provided the original version of this patch months ago, but
    other changes kept conflicting with it, so it got deferred.  Greg Edwards
    dug it out of obscurity just over a week ago, and almost immediately
    another conflicting patch appeared (Bob Picco's memory-less nodes).
    
    I've resolved the conflicts and got it running again.  CONFIG_SGI_TIOCX
    is set to "y" in defconfig, which causes a Tiger to not boot (oops in
    tiocx_init).  But that can be resolved later ... get this in now before it
    gets stale again.

    [PATCH] yet another fix for setup-bus.c/x86 merge
    
    There is a slight disagreement between setup-bus.c code and traditional
    x86 PCI setup wrt which recourses are invalid vs resources that are free
    for further allocations.
    
    In particular, in the setup-bus.c, if we failed to allocate some resource,
    we nullify "start" and "flags" fields, but *not* the "end" one.
    
    But x86 pcibios_enable_resources() does the following check:
    
    	if (!r->start && r->end) {
    		printk(KERN_ERR "PCI: Device %s not available because of resource collisions\n", pci_name(dev));
    		return -EINVAL;
    
    which means that the device owning the offending resource cannot be
    enabled.
    
    In particular, this breaks cardbus behind the normal decode p2p bridge -
    the cardbus code from setup-bus.c requests rather large IO and MEM
    windows, and if it fails, the socket is completely unavailable.  Which
    is wrong, as the yenta code is capable to allocate smaller windows.

    [IA64] memory-less-nodes repost
    
    I reworked how nodes with only CPUs are treated.  The patch below seems
    simpler to me and has eliminated the complicated routine
    reassign_cpu_only_nodes.  There isn't any longer the requirement
    to modify ACPI NUMA information which was in large part the
    complexity introduced in reassign_cpu_only_nodes.
    
    This patch will produce a different number of nodes. For example,
    reassign_cpu_only_nodes would reduce two CPUonly nodes and one memory node
    configuration to one memory+CPUs node configuration.  This patch
    doesn't change the number of nodes which means the user will see three.  Two
    nodes without memory and one node with all the memory.
    
    While doing this patch, I noticed that early_nr_phys_cpus_node isn't serving
    any useful purpose.  It is called once in find_pernode_space but the value
    isn't used to computer pernode space.

    [IA64] hotplug/ia64: SN Hotplug Driver - new SN PROM version code
    
    This patch is a rewrite of the code to check the PROM version.  The current
    code has some deficiences in the way PROM comparisons were made.  The minimum
    value of PROM that will boot has also been changed to 4.04.

    [PATCH] ARM: 2792/1: IXP4xx iomap API implementation
    
    Patch from Deepak Saxena
    
    This patch implements the iomap API for Intel IXP4xx NPU systems.
    We need to implement our own version of the API functions b/c of the
    PCI hostbridge does not provide the capability to map PCI I/O space
    into the CPU's physical memory space. In addition, if a system has
    more than 64M of PCI memory mapped BARs, PCI memory must also be
    accessed indirectly.  This patch changes the assignment of PCI I/O
    resources to fall into to 0x0000:0xffff range so that we can trap
    I/O areas in our ioread/iowrite macros.

    [CRYPTO] Add x86_64 asm AES
    
    Implementation:
    ===============
    The encrypt/decrypt code is based on an x86 implementation I did a while
    ago which I never published. This unpublished implementation does
    include an assembler based key schedule and precomputed tables. For
    simplicity and best acceptance, however, I took Gladman's in-kernel code
    for table generation and key schedule for the kernel port of my
    assembler code and modified this code to produce the key schedule as
    required by my assembler implementation. File locations and Kconfig are
    kept similar to the i586 AES assembler implementation.
    It may seem a little bit strange to use 32 bit I/O and registers in the
    assembler implementation but this gives the best code size. My
    implementation takes one instruction more per round compared to
    Gladman's x86 assembler but it doesn't require any stack for local
    variables or saved registers and it is less serialized than Gladman's
    code.
    Note that all comparisons to Gladman's code were done after my code was
    implemented. I did only use FIPS PUB 197 for the implementation so my
    implementation is independent work.
    If anybody has a better assembler solution for x86_64 I'll be pleased to
    have my code replaced with the better solution.
    
    Testing:
    ========
    The implementation passes the in-kernel crypto testing module and I'm
    running it without any problems on my laptop where it is mainly used for
    dm-crypt.
    
    Microbenchmark:
    ===============
    The microbenchmark was done in userspace with similar compile flags as
    used during kernel compile.
    Encrypt/decrypt is about 35% faster than the generic C implementation.
    As the generic C as well as my assembler implementation are both table
    I don't really expect that there is much room for further
    improvements though I'll be glad to be corrected here.
    The key schedule is about 5% slower than the generic C implementation.
    This is due to the fact that some more work has to be done in the key
    schedule routine to fit the schedule to the assembler implementation.
    
    Code Size:
    ==========
    Encrypt and decrypt are together about 2.1 Kbytes smaller than the
    generic C implementation which is important with regard to L1 cache
    usage. The key schedule routine is about 100 bytes larger than the
    generic C implementation.
    
    Data Size:
    ==========
    There's no difference in data size requirements between the assembler
    implementation and the generic C implementation.
    
    License:
    ========
    Gladmans's code is dual BSD/GPL whereas my assembler code is GPLv2 only
    (I'm  not going to change the license for my code). So I had to change
    the module license for the x86_64 aes module from 'Dual BSD/GPL' to
    'GPL' to reflect the most restrictive license within the module.

    [CRYPTO] Add null short circuit to crypto_free_tfm
    
    As far as I'm aware there's a general concensus that functions that are
    responsible for freeing resources should be able to cope with being passed
    a NULL pointer. This makes sense as it removes the need for all callers to
    check for NULL, thus elliminating the bugs that happen when some forget
    (safer to just check centrally in the freeing function) and it also makes
    for smaller code all over due to the lack of all those NULL checks.
    This patch makes it safe to pass the crypto_free_tfm() function a NULL
    pointer. Once this patch is applied we can start removing the NULL checks
    from the callers.

    [CRYPTO] Add alignmask for low-level cipher implementations
    
    The VIA Padlock device requires the input and output buffers to
    be aligned on 16-byte boundaries.  This patch adds the alignmask
    attribute for low-level cipher implementations to indicate their
    alignment requirements.
    
    The mid-level crypt() function will copy the input/output buffers
    if they are not aligned correctly before they are passed to the
    low-level implementation.
    
    Strictly speaking, some of the software implementations require
    the buffers to be aligned on 4-byte boundaries as they do 32-bit
    loads.  However, it is not clear whether it is better to copy
    the buffers or pay the penalty for unaligned loads/stores.

    [CRYPTO] Add plumbing for multi-block operations
    
    The VIA Padlock device is able to perform much better when multiple
    blocks are fed to it at once.  As this device offers an exceptional
    throughput rate it is worthwhile to optimise the infrastructure
    specifically for it.
    
    We shift the existing page-sized fast path down to the CBC/ECB functions.
    We can then replace the CBC/ECB functions with functions provided by the
    underlying algorithm that performs the multi-block operations.
    
    As a side-effect this improves the performance of large cipher operations
    for all existing algorithm implementations.  I've measured the gain to be
    around 5% for 3DES and 15% for AES.

    [PATCH] openfirmware: implement hotplug for macio devices
    
    This adds the hotplug routine for generating hotplug events when devices
    are seen on the macio bus.  It uses the attributed created by the sysfs
    nodes to generate the hotplug environment vars for userspace.
    
    Since the characters allowed inside the 'compatible' field are NUL
    terminated, they are exported as individual OF_COMPATIBLE_# variables,
    with OF_COMPATIBLE_N maintaining a count of how many there are.
    
    In order for hotplug to work with macio devices, patches to
    module-init-tools and hotplug must be applied.  Those patches are

             parameter was treated as the output buffer, memory corruption would
             result, causing Oopsen very quickly.

    [PATCH] openfirmware: generate device table for userspace
    
    This converts the usage of struct of_match to struct of_device_id,
    similar to pci_device_id.  This allows a device table to be generated,
    which can be parsed by depmod(8) to generate a map file for module
    loading.

    [PATCH] Fix broken kmalloc_node in rc1/rc2
    
    This patch used to be in Andrew's tree before the NUMA slab allocator went
    in. Either this patch or the NUMA slab allocator is needed in order for
    kmalloc_node to work correctly.
    
    pcibus_to_node may be used to generate the node information passed to
    kmalloc_node. pcibus_to_node returns -1 if it was not able to determine
    on which node a pcibus is located. For that case kmalloc_node must
    work like kmalloc.

    As part of my timeofday rework, I've been looking at the NTP code and I

    This could cause problems when time_offset changed by the NTP code.  This

    [TCP]: Move to new TSO segmenting scheme.
    
    Make TSO segment transmit size decisions at send time not earlier.
    
    The basic scheme is that we try to build as large a TSO frame as
    possible when pulling in the user data, but the size of the TSO frame
    output to the card is determined at transmit time.
    
    This is guided by tp->xmit_size_goal.  It is always set to a multiple
    of MSS and tells sendmsg/sendpage how large an SKB to try and build.
    
    Later, tcp_write_xmit() and tcp_push_one() chop up the packet if
    necessary and conditions warrant.  These routines can also decide to
    "defer" in order to wait for more ACKs to arrive and thus allow larger
    TSO frames to be emitted.
    
    A general observation is that TSO elongates the pipe, thus requiring a
    larger congestion window and larger buffering especially at the sender
    side.  Therefore, it is important that applications 1) get a large
    enough socket send buffer (this is accomplished by our dynamic send
    buffer expansion code) 2) do large enough writes.

    [TCP]: Fix __tcp_push_pending_frames() 'nonagle' handling.
    
    'nonagle' should be passed to the tcp_snd_test() function
    as 'TCP_NAGLE_PUSH' if we are checking an SKB not at the
    tail of the write_queue.  This is because Nagle does not
    apply to such frames since we cannot possibly tack more
    data onto them.
    
    However, while doing this __tcp_push_pending_frames() makes
    all of the packets in the write_queue use this modified
    'nonagle' value.
    
    Fix the bug and simplify this function by just calling
    tcp_write_xmit() directly if sk_send_head is non-NULL.
    
    As a result, we can now make tcp_data_snd_check() just call
    tcp_push_pending_frames() instead of the specialized
    __tcp_data_snd_check().

    When we add any new packet to the TCP socket write queue,
    we must call skb_header_release() on it in order for the

    Using this as a baseline, we can begin to untangle the mess of

    all of the redundant computation that occurs when outputting data

    [TCP]: Fix quick-ack decrementing with TSO.
    
    On each packet output, we call tcp_dec_quickack_mode()
    if the ACK flag is set.  It drops tp->ack.quick until
    it hits zero, at which time we deflate the ATO value.
    
    When doing TSO, we are emitting multiple packets with
    ACK set, so we should decrement tp->ack.quick that many
    segments.
    
    Note that, unlike this case, tcp_enter_cwr() should not
    take the tcp_skb_pcount(skb) into consideration.  That
    function, one time, readjusts tp->snd_cwnd and moves
    into TCP_CA_CWR state.

    [TCP]: Simplify SKB data portion allocation with NETIF_F_SG.
    
    The ideal and most optimal layout for an SKB when doing
    scatter-gather is to put all the headers at skb->data, and
    all the user data in the page array.
    
    This makes SKB splitting and combining extremely simple,
    especially before a packet goes onto the wire the first
    time.
    
    So, when sk_stream_alloc_pskb() is given a zero size, make
    sure there is no skb_tailroom().  This is achieved by applying
    SKB_DATA_ALIGN() to the header length used here.
    
    Next, make select_size() in TCP output segmentation use a
    length of zero when NETIF_F_SG is true on the outgoing
    interface.

    - rt_check_expire() fixes (an overflow occured if size of the hash
      was >= 65536)
    
    reminder of the bugfix:
    
    The rt_check_expire() has a serious problem on machines with large
    route caches, and a standard HZ value of 1000.
    
    With default values, ie ip_rt_gc_interval = 60*HZ = 60000 ;
    
    the loop count :
    
         for (t = ip_rt_gc_interval << rt_hash_log; t >= 0;
    
    
    overflows (t is a 31 bit value) as soon rt_hash_log is >= 16  (65536
    slots in route cache hash table).
    
    In this case, rt_check_expire() does nothing at all

    [NET]: Fix signedness issues in net/core/filter.c
    
    This is the code to load packet data into a register:

                            if (k < 0) {
    ...
                            } else {
                                    u32 _tmp, *p;
                                    p = skb_header_pointer(skb, k, 4, &_tmp);
                                    if (p != NULL) {
                                            A = ntohl(*p);
                                            continue;
                                    }
                            }
    
    skb_header_pointer checks if the requested data is within the
    linear area:
    
            int hlen = skb_headlen(skb);
    
            if (offset + len <= hlen)
                    return skb->data + offset;
    
    When offset is within [INT_MAX-len+1..INT_MAX] the addition will
    result in a negative number which is <= hlen.
    
    I couldn't trigger a crash on my AMD64 with 2GB of memory, but a
    coworker tried on his x86 machine and it crashed immediately.
    
    This patch fixes the check in skb_header_pointer to handle large
    positive offsets similar to skb_copy_bits. Invalid data can still
    be accessed using negative offsets (also similar to skb_copy_bits),
    anyone using negative offsets needs to verify them himself.

    [SPARC64]: Do proper DMA IRQ syncing on Tomatillo
    
    This was the main impetus behind adding the PCI IRQ shim.
    
    In order to properly order DMA writes wrt. interrupts, you have to
    write to a PCI controller register, then poll for that bit clearing.
    There is one bit for each interrupt source, and setting this register
    bit tells Tomatillo to drain all pending DMA from that device.
    
    Furthermore, Tomatillo's with revision less than 4 require us to do a
    block store due to some memory transaction ordering issues it has on
    JBUS.

    This allows a PCI controller to shim into IRQ delivery
    so that DMA queues can be drained, if necessary.
    
    If some bus specific code needs to run before an IRQ
    handler is invoked, the bus driver simply needs to setup
    the function pointer in bucket->irq_info->pre_handler and
    the two args bucket->irq_info->pre_handler_arg[12].
    
    The Schizo PCI driver is converted over to use a pre-handler
    for the DMA write-sync processing it needs when a device
    is behind a PCI->PCI bus deeper than the top-level APB
    bridges.
    
    While we're here, clean up all of the action allocation
    and handling.  Now, we allocate the irqaction as part of
    the bucket->irq_info area.  There is an array of 4 irqaction
    (for PCI irq sharing) and a bitmask saying which entries
    are active.
    
    The bucket->irq_info is allocated at build_irq() time, not
    at request_irq() time.  This simplifies request_irq() and
    free_irq() tremendously.
    
    The SMP dynamic IRQ retargetting code got removed in this
    change too.  It was disabled for a few months now, and we
    can resurrect it in the future if we want.

    [SPARC]: bpp: remove sleep_on usage
    
    Use schedule_timeout() instead of sleep_on + timer.  Totally untested
    due to lack of hardware, but the changes are rather trivial.

    [SPARC64/COMPAT]: Add some compat ioctl for ppdev
    
    The following patch adds some ioctls to include/linux/compat_ioctl.h
    to allow using ppdev from the 32 bit user space on sparc64.
    
    This patch also adds the PPDEV option in the sparc64 menu, near Parallel
    printer support in the 'General machine setup' submenu.
    
    All those ioctls seem to be compatible, since (correct me if I'm wrong)
    they dont use the 'long' type. See include/linux/ppdev.h.
    
    The application I used to test the new ioctls only used the following:
    PPEXCL
    PPCLAIM
    PPNEGOT
    PPGETMODES
    PPRCONTROL
    PPWCONTROL
    PPDATADIR
    PPWDATA
    PPRDATA
    
    But I beleive that the other ioctls will work fine.

    Patch from Catalin Marinas
    
    The range for the ARMv6 block cache operations is inclusive but the
    kernel doesn't re-calculate the end address, causing a page fault when
    used (this only happens with support for cache aliasing, otherwise the
    blk_flush_kern_dcache_page() is not called). This patch subtracts
    L1_CACHE_BYTES from the end address.

    [SCSI] lpfc: Fix LS_RJT never sent by lpfc_els_unsol_event()
    
    lpfc_els_unsol_event() checks rjt_err to determine is LS_RJT should be
    sent.  However, rjt_err was set to LSEXP_NOTHING_ELSE (which is 0) in
    cases where an LS_RJT should be sent, so rjt_err was never true.
    Change lpfc_els_unsol_event() to set rjt_err to 1 when LS_RJT should
    be sent.

    [SCSI] lpfc: Fixes in mbox_timeout_handler
    
    Analysis:
    
    Timeout of READ_SPARM64 causes call to lpfc_mbox_timeout_handler which
    reads psli->mbox_active to determine the timeout mbox.  Timeout
    handler then NULL's psli->mbox_active and calls
    lpfc_mbx_cmpl_read_sparam(), which on timeout condition, calls
    link_down().  link_down() now calls disc_done() which calls
    mbox_timeout_hander() again since WORKER_MBOX_TMO is still set, which
    goes back to read psli->mbox_active which is already NULL'ed.
    
    Remove redundant if statement in lpfc_mbox_timeout_handler.  pmbox is
    assigned psli->mbox_active so there is no need to check if it actually
    equals psli->mbox_active.

    [PATCH] PCI: clean up dynamic pci id logic
    
    The dynamic pci id logic has been bothering me for a while, and now that
    I started to look into how to move some of this to the driver core, I
    thought it was time to clean it all up.
    
    It ends up making the code smaller, and easier to follow, and fixes a
    few bugs at the same time (dynamic ids were not being matched
    everywhere, and so could be missed on some call paths for new devices,
    semaphore not needed to be grabbed when adding a new id and calling the
    driver core, etc.)
    
    I also renamed the function pci_match_device() to pci_match_id() as
    that's what it really does.

    [PATCH] PCI: pci_assign_unassigned_resources() on x86
    
    - Add sanity check for io[port,mem]_resource in setup-bus.c. These
      resources look like "free" as they have no parents, but obviously
      we must not touch them.
    - In i386.c:pci_allocate_bus_resources(), if a bridge resource cannot be
      allocated for some reason, then clear its flags. This prevents any child
      allocations in this range, so the setup-bus code will work with a clean
      resource sub-tree.
    - i386.c:pcibios_enable_resources() doesn't enable bridges, as it checks
      only resources 0-5, which looks like a clear bug to me. I suspect it
      might break hotplug as well in some cases.

    [PATCH] PCI: handle subtractive decode pci-pci bridge better
    
    With the number of PCI bus resources increased to 8, we can
    handle the subtractive decode PCI-PCI bridge like a normal
    bridge, taking into account standard PCI-PCI bridge windows
    (resources 0-2). This helps to avoid problems with peer-to-peer DMA
    behind such bridges, poor performance for MMIO ranges outside bridge
    windows and prefetchable vs. non-prefetchable memory issues.
    
    To reflect the fact that such bridges do forward all addresses to
    the secondary bus (transparency), remaining bus resources 3-7 are
    linked to resources 0-4 of the primary bus. These resources will be
    used as fallback by resource management code if allocation from
    standard bridge windows fails for some reason.

    This patch increases the number of resource pointers in the

    for host bridges and transparent PCI bridges. With this change,
    all PCI buses will have more resource pointers, but most PCI
    buses will only use the first 3 or 4, the remaining being NULL.
    The PCI core already deals with this correctly.

    [PATCH] alpha smp fix
    
    As usual, the reason of this breakage is quite silly: in do_entIF, we
    are checking for PS == 0 to see whether it was a kernel BUG() or
    userspace trap.
    
    It works, unless BUG() happens in interrupt - PS is not 0 in kernel mode
    due to non-zero IPL, and the things get messed up horribly then.  In
    this particular case it was BUG_ON(!irqs_disabled()) triggered in
    run_posix_cpu_timers(), so we ended up shooting "current" with the
    bursts of one SIGTRAP and three SIGILLs on every timer tick.  ;-)

    Patch from Catalin Marinas
    
    This patch calculates the AFS partition length by expanding the image

    [PATCH] Improper initrd failure message at boot time
    
    On system boot up, there was an failure reported to boot.msg:
    
         <5>Trying to move old root to /initrd ... failed
    
    According to initrd(4) man page, step #7 of BOOT-UP OPERATION
    is described as below:
              7. If the normal root file has directory /initrd, device
              /dev/ram0 is moved from  /  to  /initrd.   Otherwise  if
              directory  /initrd  does  not  exist device /dev/ram0 is
              unmounted.
    
    We got service calls from customers concerning about this failure message
    at boot time.  Many systems do not have /initrd and thus the message can be
    changed in the case of non-existing /initrd so that it does not sound like
    a failure of the system.

    [PATCH] selinux_sb_copy_data() should not require a whole page
    
    Currently selinux_sb_copy_data requires an entire page be allocated to
    *orig when the function is called.  This "requirement" is based on the fact
    that we call copy_page(in_save, nosec_save) and in_save = orig when the
    data is not FS_BINARY_MOUNTDATA.  This means that if a caller were to call
    do_kern_mount with only about 10 bytes of options, they would get passed
    here and then we would corrupt PAGE_SIZE - 10 bytes of memory (with all
    zeros.)
    
    Currently it appears all in kernel FS's use one page of data so this has
    not been a problem.  An out of kernel FS did just what is described above
    and it would almost always panic shortly after they tried to mount.  From
    looking else where in the kernel it is obvious that this string of data
    must always be null terminated.  (See example in do_mount where it always
    zeros the last byte.) Thus I suggest we use strcpy in place of copy_page.
    In this way we make sure the amount we copy is always less than or equal to
    the amount we received and since do_mount is zeroing the last byte this
    should be safe for all.

    [PATCH] driver core: Add the ability to bind drivers to devices from userspace
    
    This adds a single file, "bind", to the sysfs directory of every driver
    registered with the driver core.  To bind a device to a driver, write
    the bus id of the device you wish to bind to that specific driver to the
    "bind" file (remember to not add a trailing \n).  If that bus id matches
    a device on that bus, and it does not currently have a driver bound to
    it, the probe sequence will be initiated with that driver and device.
    
    Note, this requires that the driver itself be willing and able to accept
    that device (usually through a device id type table).  This patch does
    not make it possible to override the driver's id table.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Replace custom locking code with a spinlock
    
    The hvlpevent_queue (formally ItLpQueue) has a member called xInUseWord
    which is used for serialising access to the queue. Because it's a word
    (ie. 32 bit) there's a custom 32-bit version of test_and_set_bit() or
    thereabouts in ItLpQueue.c.
    
    The xInUseWord is not shared with they hypervisor, so we can replace it
    with a spinlock and remove the custom code.
    
    There is also another locking mechanism (ItLpQueueInProcess). This is
    redundant because it's only manipulated while the lock's held. Remove it.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Remove lpqueue pointer from the paca on iSeries
    
    The iSeries code keeps a pointer to the ItLpQueue in its paca struct. But
    all these pointers end up pointing to the one place, ie. xItLpQueue.
    
    So remove the pointer from the paca struct and just refer to xItLpQueue
    directly where needed.
    
    The only complication is that the spread_lpevents logic was implemented by
    having a NULL lpqueue pointer in the paca on CPUs that weren't supposed to
    process events. Instead we just compare the spread_lpevents value to the
    processor id to get the same behaviour.

    The only ports which remain in asm-*/serial.h are the platform specific

    I am using the atxp1 module to change vcore on my NForce2 via userspace

    Currently the atxp1 module will write to the log on every vcore change,

    [MTD] NAND: Reorganize chip locking
    
    The code was wrong in several aspects. The locking order was
    inconsistent, the device aquire code did not reset a variable
    after a wakeup and the wakeup handling was not working for
    applications where multiple chips are sharing a single
    hardware controller.
    When a hardware controller is available the locking is now
    reduced to the hardware controller lock and the waitqueue is
    moved to the hardware controller structure in order to avoid
    a wake_up_all().
    
    The problem was pointed out by Ben Dooks, who also found the
    missing variable reset as main cause for his deadlock problem.

    [PATCH] irqpoll
    
    Anyone reporting a stuck IRQ should try these options.  Its effectiveness
    varies we've found in the Fedora case.  Quite a few systems with misdescribed
    IRQ routing just work when you use irqpoll.  It also fixes up the VIA systems
    although thats now fixed with the VIA quirk (which we could just make default
    as its what Redmond OS does but Linus didn't like it historically).
    
    A small number of systems have jammed IRQ sources or misdescribes that cause
    an IRQ that we have no handler registered anywhere for.  In those cases it
    doesn't help.

    [PATCH] ext3: reduce allocate-with-reservation lock latencies
    
    Currently in ext3 block reservation code, the global filesystem reservation
    tree lock (rsv_block) is hold during the process of searching for a space
    to make a new reservation window, including while scaning the block bitmap
    to verify if the avalible window has a free block.  Holding the lock during
    bitmap scan is unnecessary and could possibly cause scalability issue and
    latency issues.
    
    This patch tries to address this by dropping the lock before scan the
    bitmap.  Before that we need to reserve the open window in case someone
    else is targetting at the same window.  Question was should we reserve the
    whole free reservable space or just the window size we need.  Reserve the
    whole free reservable space will possibly force other threads which
    intended to do block allocation nearby move to another block group(cause
    bad layout).  In this patch, we just reserve the desired size before drop
    the lock and scan the block bitmap.  This patch fixed a ext3 reservation
    latency issue seen on a cvs check out test.  Patch is tested with many fsx,
    tiobench, dbench and untar a kernel test.

    [PATCH] blk: light iocontext ops
    
    get_io_context needlessly turned off interrupts and checked for racing io
    context creations.  Both of which aren't needed, because the io context can
    only be created while in process context of the current process.
    
    Also, split the function in 2.  A light version, current_io_context does not
    elevate the reference count specifically, but can be used when in process
    context, because the process holds a reference itself.

    [PATCH] blk: __make_request efficiency
    
    In the case where the request is not able to be merged by the elevator, don't
    retake the lock and retry the merge mechanism after allocating a new request.
    
    Instead assume that the chance of a merge remains slim, and now that we've
    done most of the work allocating a request we may as well just go with it.
    
    Also be rid of the GFP_ATOMIC allocation: we've got working mempools for the
    block layer now, so let's save atomic memory for things like networking.
    
    Lastly, in get_request_wait, do an initial get_request call before going into
    the waitqueue.  This is reported to help efficiency.

    [PATCH] ITIMER_REAL: fix possible deadlock and race
    
    As Steven Rostedt pointed out, there are 2 problems with ITIMER_REAL
    timers.
    
    1. do_setitimer() does not call del_timer_sync() in case
       when the timer is not pending (it_real_value() returns 0).
       This is wrong, the timer may still be running, and it can
       rearm itself.
    
    2. It calls del_timer_sync() with tsk->sighand->siglock held.
       This is deadlockable, because timer's handler needs this
       lock too.

    [NETFILTER]: Fix connection tracking bug in 2.6.12
    
    In 2.6.12 we started dropping the conntrack reference when a packet
    leaves the IP layer. This broke connection tracking on a bridge,
    because bridge-netfilter defers calling some NF_IP_* hooks to the bridge
    layer for locally generated packets going out a bridge, where the
    conntrack reference is no longer available. This patch keeps the
    reference in this case as a temporary solution, long term we will
    remove the defered hook calling. No attempt is made to drop the
    reference in the bridge-code when it is no longer needed, tc actions
    could already have sent the packet anywhere.

    [IPVS]: Close race conditions on ip_vs_conn_tab list modification
    
    In an smp system, it is possible for an connection timer to expire, calling
    ip_vs_conn_expire while the connection table is being flushed, before
    ct_write_lock_bh is acquired.
    
    Since the list iterator loop in ip_vs_con_flush releases and re-acquires the
    spinlock (even though it doesn't re-enable softirqs), it is possible for the
    expiration function to modify the connection list, while it is being traversed
    in ip_vs_conn_flush.
    
    The result is that the next pointer gets set to NULL, and subsequently
    dereferenced, resulting in an oops.

    [NET]: Remove gratuitous use of skb->tail in network drivers.
    
    Many drivers use skb->tail unnecessarily.
    
    In these situations, the code roughly looks like:
    
    	dev = dev_alloc_skb(...);
    
    	[optional] skb_reserve(skb, ...);
    
    	... skb->tail ...
    
    But even if the skb_reserve() happens, skb->data equals
    skb->tail.  So it doesn't make any sense to use anything
    other than skb->data in these cases.
    
    Another case was the s2io.c driver directly mucking with
    the skb->data and skb->tail pointers.  It really just wanted
    to do an skb_reserve(), so that's what the code was changed
    to do instead.
    
    Another reason I'm making this change as it allows some SKB
    cleanups I have planned simpler to merge.  In those cleanups,
    skb->head, skb->tail, and skb->end pointers are removed, and
    replaced with skb->head_room and skb->tail_room integers.

    [PATCH] ll_rw_blk: prevent huge request allocations
    
    Currently we cap request allocations at q->nr_requests, but we allow a
    batching io context to allocate up to 32 more (default setting).  This
    can flood the queue with request allocations, with only a few batching
    processes.  The real fix would be to limit the number of batchers, but
    as that isn't currently tracked, I suggest we just cap the maximum
    number of allocated requests to eg 50% over the limit.
    
    This was observed in real life, users typically see this as vmstat bo
    numbers going off the wall with seconds of no queueing afterwards.
    Behaviour this bursty is not beneficial.

    [IPV4]: ipconfig.c: fix dhcp timeout behaviour
    
    I think there is a small bug in ipconfig.c in case IPCONFIG_DHCP is set
    and dhcp is used.
    
    When a DHCPOFFER is received, ip address is kept until we get DHCPACK.
    If no ack is received, ic_dynamic() returns negatively, but leaves the
    offered ip address in ic_myaddr.
    
    This makes the main loop in ip_auto_config() break and uses the maybe
    incomplete configuration.
    
    Not sure if it's the best way to do, but the following trivial patch
    correct this.

    This patch greatly speeds up the handling of lfetch.fault instructions
    which result in NaT consumption. Due to the NaT-page mapped at address
    0, this is guaranteed to happen when lfetch.fault'ing a NULL pointer.
    With this patch in place, we can even define prefetch()/prefetchw() as
    lfetch.fault without significant performance degradation.  More
    importantly, it allows compilers to be more aggressive with using
    lfetch.fault on pointers that might be NULL.

    + Change globals to vga_console_iobase/vga_console_membase and make them
      unconditional.
    + Address style-related comments.
    
    Patch to extend the PCDP vga setup code to support PCI io/mem translations

    drivers/firmware/pcdp.h
    -----------------------
    + add declaration for the spec-defined PCI interface struct (pcdp_if_pci)
      as well as support macros.
    
    + extend setup_vga_console() to know about pcdp_if_pci and add a couple of
      globals to hold the io and mem translation offsets if present.
    
    arch/ia64/kernel/setup.c
    ------------------------
    + tweek early_console_setup() to allow multiple early console setup routines
      to be called.

    On partitioned systems we can wind up creating spurious symlinks in

    not broken; the problem is that we're potentially misinforming

    [PATCH] PCI: DMA bursting advice
    
    After seeing, at best, "guesses" as to the following kind
    of information in several drivers, I decided that we really
    need a way for platforms to specifically give advice in this
    area for what works best with their PCI controller implementation.
    
    Basically, this new interface gives DMA bursting advice on
    PCI.  There are three forms of the advice:
    
    1) Burst as much as possible, it is not necessary to end bursts
       on some particular boundary for best performance.
    
    2) Burst on some byte count multiple.  A DMA burst to some multiple of
       number of bytes may be done, but it is important to end the burst
       on an exact multiple for best performance.
    
       The best example of this I am aware of are the PPC64 PCI
       controllers, where if you end a burst mid-cacheline then
       chip has to refetch the data and the IOMMU translations
       which hurts performance a lot.
    
    3) Burst on a single byte count multiple.  Bursts shall end
       exactly on the next multiple boundary for best performance.
    
       Sparc64 and Alpha's PCI controllers operate this way.  They
       disconnect any device which tries to burst across a cacheline
       boundary.
    
       Actually, newer sparc64 PCI controllers do not have this behavior.
       That is why the "pdev" is passed into the interface, so I can
       add code later to check which PCI controller the system is using
       and give advice accordingly.

    [PATCH] PCI: fix-pci-mmap-on-ppc-and-ppc64.patch
    
    This is an updated version of Ben's fix-pci-mmap-on-ppc-and-ppc64.patch
    which is in 2.6.12-rc4-mm1.
    
    It fixes the patch to work on PPC iSeries, removes some debug printks
    at Ben's request, and incorporates your
    fix-pci-mmap-on-ppc-and-ppc64-fix.patch also.
    
    Originally from Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>
    
    This patch was discussed at length on linux-pci and so far, the last
    iteration of it didn't raise any comment.  It's effect is a nop on
    architecture that don't define the new pci_resource_to_user() callback
    anyway.  It allows architecture like ppc who put weird things inside of
    PCI resource structures to convert to some different value for user
    visible ones.  It also fixes mmap'ing of IO space on those archs.

    [PATCH] ACPI based I/O APIC hot-plug: add interfaces
    
    This patch adds the following new interfaces for I/O xAPIC
    hotplug. The implementation of these interfaces depends on each
    architecture.
    
        o int acpi_register_ioapic(acpi_handle handle, u64 phys_addr,
    			       u32 gsi_base);
    
            This new interface is to add a new I/O xAPIC specified by
            phys_addr and gsi_base pair. phys_addr is the physical address
            to which the I/O xAPIC is mapped and gsi_base is global system
            interrupt base of the I/O xAPIC. acpi_register_ioapic returns
            0 on success, or negative value on error.
    
        o int acpi_unregister_ioapic(acpi_handle handle, u32 gsi_base);
    
            This new interface is to remove a I/O xAPIC specified by

    [PATCH] acpi bridge hotadd: ACPI based root bridge hot-add
    
    When you hot-plug a (root) bridge hierarchy, it may have p2p bridges and
    devices attached to it that have not been configured by firmware.  In this
    case, we need to configure the devices before starting them.  This patch
    separates device start from device scan so that we can introduce the
    configuration step in the middle.
    
    I kept the existing semantics for pci_scan_bus() since there are a huge number
    of callers to that function.
    
    Also, I have no way of testing the changes I made to the parisc files, so this
    needs review by those folks.  Sorry for the massive cross-post, this touches
    files in many different places.

    [PATCH] PCI Allow OutOfRange PIRQ table address
    
    I updated this to remove unnecessary variable initialization, make
    check_routing be inline only and not __init, switch to strtoul, and
    formatting fixes as per Randy Dunlap's recommendations.
    
    I updated this to change pirq_table_addr to a long, and to add a warning
    msg if the PIRQ table wasn't found at the specified address, as per thread
    with Matthew Wilcox.
    
    In our hardware situation, the BIOS is unable to store or generate it's PIRQ
    table in the F0000h-100000h standard range. This patch adds a pci kernel
    parameter, pirqaddr to allow the bootloader (or BIOS based loader) to inform
    the kernel where the PIRQ table got stored. A beneficial side-effect is that,
    if one's BIOS uses a static address each time for it's PIRQ table, then
    pirqaddr can be used to avoid the $pirq search through that address block each
    time at boot for normal PIRQ BIOSes.

    [PATCH] Use pci_set_dma_mask() instead of direct assignment of DMA mask
    
    The amd8111e driver directly assigns the DMA mask to the dma_mask
    member of the struct pci_dev instead of using pci_set_dma_mask(). This
    makes the call to pci_dma_supported() redundant as pci_set_dma_mask()
    does this check.
    
    I do not own this device so I only compile-tested this patch.

    [PATCH] smc91x needs settable IRQ trigger type
    
    For boards that invert the SMC91x IRQ line (maybe an FPGA inverts it),
    the set_irq_type() call can't assume IRQT_RISING.  These particular
    boards currently use OMAP-specific calls to change the trigger type,
    but the boards break when set_irq_type() stops being a NOP.

    [PATCH] ACPI-based PCI resources: PCMCIA bugfix, but resources missing in trees
    
    Don't auto-configure yenta sockets for PCMCIA devices if it is connected to
    the root PCI bus on the x86 or x86_64 architectures.  Previously, this was
    handled by the "ioport_resource"/"iomem_resource" check a few lines below,
    but with the new ACPI-based resource handling this doesn't catch all cases
    any longer.
    
    pci-yenta-cardbus-fix.patch and this patch should solve the initialization
    time trouble.  However, the ACPI-based PCI resource handling is badly
    broken, IMHO:
    
    - many resources of devices don't show up in the resource trees (
      /proc/iomem and /proc/ioports) any longer. This means that PCMCIA, but
      also possibly other subsystems (ISA, PnP, ...) do not know which resources
      it cannot use.
    
    - verify_root_windows() should fail if there are no iomem _or_ ioport
      resources, not only if there are no iomem _and_ ioport resources.

    [PATCH] pcmcia: 8 and 16 bit access for static_map
    
    The PCMCIA card services layer is never setting the i/o map attributes when
    SS_CAP_STATIC_MAP is specified.  Net result, sockets' set_io_map() calls
    always see requests with most flags clear, meaning 8 bit access.
    
    For hardware that always autosizes, that won't matter; and all current
    STATIC_MAP drivers ignore those attributes.  A new driver (for at91rm9200)
    suffers badly from this, since this forces everything into 8 bit mode and
    that breaks both (a) cards requiring 16 bit access, and (b) ide-cs; but of
    course 8-bit cards work OK (as does accessing card attributes).
    
    So this patch arranges to pass the attributes down, matching the behavior
    for non-static mappings (using the first/only I/O window).

    [PATCH] pcmcia: allow function-ID based match
    
    The "func_id"-based matching is very fuzzy and can lead to false positives.
    Therefore, it should be tried to avoid relying on these matches.  Until
    most/all existing func_id-based matches are replaced by
    manf_id/card_id/prod_id matches (a patch which will ask to send the
    appropriate card information to the PCMCIA mailing list will be added once
    other, more pressing issues are adressed), we need to emulate cardmgr
    behaviour by allowing func_id matches if no manf_id/card_id/prod_id match
    occurs.  This can only be done in userspace because of modules possibly loaded
    with long delays.  So, add a per-device sysfs file for this purpose.

    In -mm1 the cardbus resources might be assigned in

    Then yenta_allocate_res() tries to assign these resources again and,
    naturally, fails.
    
    This adds check for already assigned cardbus resources.

    [PATCH] ide: sensible probing for PCI systems
    
    Old ISA/VESA systems sometimes put tertiary IDE controllers at addresses
    0x1e8, 0x168, 0x1e0 or 0x160.  Linux thus probes these addresses on x86
    systems.  Unfortunately some PCI systems now use these addresses for other
    purposes which leads to users seeing minute plus hangs during boot or even
    crashes.
    
    The following patch (again has been in Fedora for a while) only probes the
    obscure legacy ISA ports on machinea that are pre-PCI.  This seems to keep
    everyone happy and if there is someone with that utterly weird corner case
    the ide= command line still provides a get out of jail card.
    Unsurprisingly we've not found anyone so affected.

    [PATCH] ide: it8212 backport for Bartlomiej IDE
    
    This lets you throw out the iteraid stuff that has ended up back in due
    to stupid goings on in the IDE world. Its the same heavily tested code
    shipped in Fedora/Red Hat products but without the other dependancies on
    the Bartlomiej IDE layer.
    
    Pre-requisite: the ide-disk patch I sent to handle pure LBA devices.
    
    Obviously you lose things like hot unplug with the Bartlomiej IDE layer
    at the moment but that won't matter to most users.
    
    The patch does the following
    - Add IT8211/12 to pci_ids.h
    - Add Makefile/Kconfig entry
    - Add it8212 driver
    
    No core IDE code is touched by this diff
    
    Embedded system testing and the ability to force raid mode off by David
    Howells
    
    Made possible by the ite reference code, documentation and also several
    clarifications and pieces of assistance provided by ITE themselves

    [PATCH] ide: ide-generic, allow for capture of other unsupported devices
    
    The ide-generic driver gives you DMA at bios tuned speed so can actually run a
    lot of unsupported devices quite well.  It has a pci table so that it doesn't
    grab disks owned by other drivers but no way to override this.  The patch adds
    an option ide-generic-all which makes the driver grab everything going that is
    IDE class.
    
    The diff is messy because I put the special case as case 0 to make the if
    conditional and long term maintenance easier.
    
    This has been in Fedora for some time.

    [SPARC64]: Avoid membar instructions in delay slots.
    
    In particular, avoid membar instructions in the delay
    slot of a jmpl instruction.
    
    UltraSPARC-I, II, IIi, and IIe have a bug, documented in
    the UltraSPARC-IIi User's Manual, Appendix K, Erratum 51
    
    The long and short of it is that if the IMU unit misses
    on a branch or jmpl, and there is a store buffer synchronizing
    membar in the delay slot, the chip can stop fetching instructions.
    
    If interrupts are enabled or some other trap is enabled, the
    chip will unwedge itself, but performance will suffer.
    
    We already had a workaround for this bug in a few spots, but
    it's better to have the entire tree sanitized for this rule.

    [PATCH] kprobes/ia64: refuse inserting kprobe on slot 1
    
    Without the ability to atomically write 16 bytes, we can not update the
    middle slot of a bundle, slot 1, unless we stop the machine first.  This
    patch will ensure the ability to robustly insert and remove a kprobe by
    refusing to insert a kprobe on slot 1 until a mechanism is in place to
    safely handle this case.

    [PATCH] Return probe redesign: ppc64 specific implementation
    
    The following is a patch provided by Ananth Mavinakayanahalli that implements
    the new PPC64 specific parts of the new function return probe design.
    
    NOTE: Since getting Ananth's patch, I changed trampoline_probe_handler()
          to consume each of the outstanding return probem instances (feedback
          on my original RFC after Ananth cut a patch), and also added the
          arch_init() function (adding arch specific initialization.) I have
          cross compiled but have not testing this on a PPC64 machine.
    
    Changes include:
     * Addition of kretprobe_trampoline to act as a dummy function for instrumented
       functions to return to, and for the return probe infrastructure to place
       a kprobe on on, gaining control so that the return probe handler
       can be called, and so that the instruction pointer can be moved back
       to the original return address.
     * Addition of arch_init(), allowing a kprobe to be registered on
       kretprobe_trampoline
     * Addition of trampoline_probe_handler() which is used as the pre_handler
       for the kprobe inserted on kretprobe_implementation.  This is the function
       that handles the details for calling the return probe handler function
       and returning control back at the original return address
     * Addition of arch_prepare_kretprobe() which is setup as the pre_handler
       for a kprobe registered at the beginning of the target function by
       kernel/kprobes.c so that a return probe instance can be setup when
       a caller enters the target function.  (A return probe instance contains
       all the needed information for trampoline_probe_handler to do it's job.)
     * Hooks added to the exit path of a task so that we can cleanup any left-over
       return probe instances (i.e. if a task dies while inside a targeted function
       then the return probe instance was reserved at the beginning of the function
       but the function never returns so we need to mark the instance as unused.)

    [PATCH] Return probe redesign: ia64 specific implementation
    
    The following patch implements function return probes for ia64 using
    the revised design.  With this new design we no longer need to do some
    of the odd hacks previous required on the last ia64 return probe port
    that I sent out for comments.
    
    Note that this new implementation still does not resolve the problem noted
    by Keith Owens where backtrace data is lost after a return probe is hit.
    
    Changes include:
     * Addition of kretprobe_trampoline to act as a dummy function for instrumented
       functions to return to, and for the return probe infrastructure to place
       a kprobe on on, gaining control so that the return probe handler
       can be called, and so that the instruction pointer can be moved back
       to the original return address.
     * Addition of arch_init(), allowing a kprobe to be registered on
       kretprobe_trampoline
     * Addition of trampoline_probe_handler() which is used as the pre_handler
       for the kprobe inserted on kretprobe_implementation.  This is the function
       that handles the details for calling the return probe handler function
       and returning control back at the original return address
     * Addition of arch_prepare_kretprobe() which is setup as the pre_handler
       for a kprobe registered at the beginning of the target function by
       kernel/kprobes.c so that a return probe instance can be setup when

    [PATCH] Return probe redesign: architecture independent changes
    
    The following is the second version of the function return probe patches
    I sent out earlier this week.  Changes since my last submission include:
    
    * Fix in ppc64 code removing an unneeded call to re-enable preemption
    * Fix a build problem in ia64 when kprobes was turned off
    * Added another BUG_ON check to each of the architecture trampoline
      handlers
    
    My initial patch description ==>
    
     From my experiences with adding return probes to x86_64 and ia64, and the
    feedback on LKML to those patches, I think we can simplify the design
    for return probes.
    
    The following patch tweaks the original design such that:
    
    * Instead of storing the stack address in the return probe instance, the
      task pointer is stored.  This gives us all we need in order to:
        - find the correct return probe instance when we enter the trampoline
          (even if we are recursing)
        - find all left-over return probe instances when the task is going away
    
      This has the side effect of simplifying the implementation since more
      work can be done in kernel/kprobes.c since architecture specific knowledge
      of the stack layout is no longer required.  Specifically, we no longer have:
    	- arch_get_kprobe_task()
    	- arch_kprobe_flush_task()
    	- get_rp_inst_tsk()
    	- get_rp_inst()
    	- trampoline_post_handler() <see next bullet>
    
    * Instead of splitting the return probe handling and cleanup logic across
      the pre and post trampoline handlers, all the work is pushed into the
      pre function (trampoline_probe_handler), and then we skip single stepping
      the original function.  In this case the original instruction to be single
      stepped was just a NOP, and we can do without the extra interruption.
    
    The new flow of events to having a return probe handler execute when a target
    function exits is:
    
    * At system initialization time, a kprobe is inserted at the beginning of
      kretprobe_trampoline.  kernel/kprobes.c use to handle this on it's own,
      but ia64 needed to do this a little differently (i.e. a function pointer
      is really a pointer to a structure containing the instruction pointer and
      a global pointer), so I added the notion of arch_init(), so that
      kernel/kprobes.c:init_kprobes() now allows architecture specific
      initialization by calling arch_init() before exiting.  Each architecture
      now registers a kprobe on it's own trampoline function.
    
    * register_kretprobe() will insert a kprobe at the beginning of the targeted
      function with the kprobe pre_handler set to arch_prepare_kretprobe
      (still no change)
    
    * When the target function is entered, the kprobe is fired, calling
      arch_prepare_kretprobe (still no change)
    
    * In arch_prepare_kretprobe() we try to get a free instance and if one is
      available then we fill out the instance with a pointer to the return probe,
      the original return address, and a pointer to the task structure (instead
      of the stack address.)  Just like before we change the return address
      to the trampoline function and mark the instance as used.
    
      If multiple return probes are registered for a given target function,
      then arch_prepare_kretprobe() will get called multiple times for the same
      task (since our kprobe implementation is able to handle multiple kprobes
      at the same address.)  Past the first call to arch_prepare_kretprobe,
      we end up with the original address stored in the return probe instance
      pointing to our trampoline function. (This is a significant difference
      from the original arch_prepare_kretprobe design.)
    
    * Target function executes like normal and then returns to kretprobe_trampoline.
    
    * kprobe inserted on the first instruction of kretprobe_trampoline is fired
      and calls trampoline_probe_handler() (no change here)
    
    * trampoline_probe_handler() consumes each of the instances associated with
      the current task by calling the registered handler function and marking
      the instance as unused until an instance is found that has a return address
      different then the trampoline function.
    
      (change similar to my previous ia64 RFC)
    
    * If the task is killed with some left-over return probe instances (meaning
      that a target function was entered, but never returned), then we just
      free any instances associated with the task.  (Not much different other
      then we can handle this without calling architecture specific functions.)
    
      There is a known problem that this patch does not yet solve where
      registering a return probe flush_old_exec or flush_thread will put us
      in a bad state.  Most likely the best way to handle this is to not allow
      registering return probes on these two functions.
    
      (Significant change)
    
    This patch series applies to the 2.6.12-rc6-mm1 kernel, and provides:
      * kernel/kprobes.c changes
      * i386 patch of existing return probes implementation
      * x86_64 patch of existing return probe implementation
      * ia64 implementation
      * ppc64 implementation (provided by Ananth)
    
    This patch implements the architecture independant changes for a reworking
    of the kprobes based function return probes design. Changes include:
    
      * Removing functions for querying a return probe instance off a stack address
      * Removing the stack_addr field from the kretprobe_instance definition,
        and adding a task pointer
      * Adding architecture specific initialization via arch_init()
      * Removing extern definitions for the architecture trampoline functions
        (this isn't needed anymore since the architecture handles the
         initialization of the kprobe in the return probe trampoline function.)

    Now that PPC64 has no-execute support, here is a second try to fix the

    This patch fulfills a promise I made to Christoph sometime back.  I am
    removing the partition info from the CCISS_GETLUNINFO ioctl as I was informed
    my "driver had no damn business reading that structure." ;)
    
    The application folks are to use /proc or /sys for partition info from now on.
     I am only aware of a few apps that use this ioctl and I'm not sure they ever
    used the partition info.

    [PATCH] IB/mthca: Set RDMA/atomic capabilities correctly
    
    mthca apparently had the meanings of the max_rd_atomic and max_dest_rd_atomic
    QP attributes backwards.  max_rd_atomic limits the maximum number of
    outstanding RDMA/atomic requests as an initiator (on a send queue), and
    max_dest_rd_atomic specifies the resources allocated to handle RMDA/atomic
    requests from the remote end of the connection.  We were programming our QP
    context with these values swapped.

    [PATCH] seccomp: tsc disable
    
    I believe at least for seccomp it's worth to turn off the tsc, not just for
    HT but for the L2 cache too.  So it's up to you, either you turn it off
    completely (which isn't very nice IMHO) or I recommend to apply this below
    patch.
    
    This has been tested successfully on x86-64 against current cogito
    repository (i686 compiles so I didn't bother testing ;).  People selling
    the cpu through cpushare may appreciate this bit for a peace of mind.
    
    There's no way to get any timing info anymore with this applied
    (gettimeofday is forbidden of course).  The seccomp environment is
    completely deterministic so it can't be allowed to get timing info, it has
    to be deterministic so in the future I can enable a computing mode that
    does a parallel computing for each task with server side transparent
    checkpointing and verification that the output is the same from all the 2/3
    seller computers for each task, without the buyer even noticing (for now
    the verification is left to the buyer client side and there's no
    checkpointing, since that would require more kernel changes to track the
    dirty bits but it'll be easy to extend once the basic mode is finished).
    
    Eliminating a cold-cache read of the cr4 global variable will save one
    cacheline during the tlb flush while making the code per-cpu-safe at the
    same time.  Thanks to Mikael Pettersson for noticing the tlb flush wasn't
    per-cpu-safe.
    
    The global tlb flush can run from irq (IPI calling do_flush_tlb_all) but
    it'll be transparent to the switch_to code since the IPI won't make any
    change to the cr4 contents from the point of view of the interrupted code
    and since it's now all per-cpu stuff, it will not race.  So no need to
    disable irqs in switch_to slow path.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Bump PMU interrupt priority
    
    The Power Management Unit on PowerMacs is very sensitive to timeouts during
    async message exchanges.  It uses rather crude protocol based on a shift
    register with an interrupt and is almost continuously exchanging messages with
    the host CPU on laptops.
    
    This patch adds a routine to the open_pic driver to be able to select a PMU
    driver so that it bumps it's interrupt priority to above the normal level.
    
    This will allow PMU interrupts to occur while another interrupt is pending,
    and thus reduce the risk of machine beeing abruptly shutdown by the PMU due to
    a timeout in PMU communication caused by excessive interrupt latency.  The
    problem is very rare, and usually just doesn't happen, but it is still useful
    to make things even more robust.

    [PATCH] 8xx: avoid "dcbst" misbehaviour with unpopulated TLB
    
    The proposed _tlbie call at update_mmu_cache() is safe because:
    
    Addresses for which update_mmu_cache() gets invocated are never inside the
    static kernel virtual mapping, meaning that there is no risk for the
    _tlbie() here to be thrashing the pinned entry, as Dan suspected.
    
    The intermediate TLB state in which this bug can be triggered is not
    visible by userspace or any other contexts, except the page fault handling
    path.  So there is no need to worry about userspace dcbxxx users.
    
    The other solution to this is to avoid dcbst misbehaviour in the first
    place, which involves changing in-kernel "dcbst" callers to use 8xx
    specific SPR's.
    
    Summary:
    
    On 8xx, cache control instructions (particularly "dcbst" from
    flush_dcache_icache) fault as write operation if there is an unpopulated
    TLB entry for the address in question.  To workaround that, we invalidate
    the TLB here, thus avoiding dcbst misbehaviour.

    [PATCH] USB: usbcore: inverted test for resuming interfaces
    
    This one-liner fixes a test for interfaces that are already resumed.
    
    It would be nice if this could get into 2.6.12, but it's not critical
    since it only affects people doing selective (runtime) suspend/resume.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: retry hard errors
    
    This patch started life as as527, and was rediffed by me.
    
    Since the IDE interface doesn't convey much information about types of
    errors, many USB-IDE adapters report all low-level errors with SK = 0x04,
    which is supposed to be used only for non-recoverable errors.  As a result
    the SCSI midlayer doesn't retry the command.  But quite often a retry
    would succeed, whereas an unnecessary retry doesn't really hurt anything.
    
    This patch uses a recently-implemented flag to tell the SCSI midlayer that
    such hardware errors should be retried.

    This patch does two things to help reset recovery.  It started life as
    as496 and was rediffed by me.
    
    First, the patch checks the result of a CLEAR_HALT request and doesn't reset the
    endpoint's data toggle unless the request succeeded.
    
    Second, it reduces the timeout for a device reset from 20 seconds to 5
    seconds.
    
    If all goes well, then I've finally figured quilt out and this patch should
    apply cleanly.

    [PATCH] USB: wireless usb <linux/usb_ch9.h> declarations
    
    This provides declarations for new requests, descriptors, and bitfields as
    defined in the Wireless USB 1.0 spec.  Device support will involve a new
    "Wire Adapter" device class, connecting a USB Host to a cluster of wireless
    USB devices.  There will be two adapter types:
    
      * Host Wireless Adapter (HWA):  the downstream link is wireless, which
        connects a wireless USB host to wireless USB devices (not unlike like
        a hub) including to the second type of adapter.
    
      * Device Wireless Adapter (DWA): the upstream link is wireless, for
        connecting existing USB devices through wired links into the cluser.
    
    All wireless USB devices will need persistent (and secure!) key storage, and
    it's probable that Linux -- or device firmware -- will need to be involved
    with that to bootstrap the initial secure key exchange.
    
    Some user interface is required in that initial key exchange, and since the
    most "hands-off" one is a wired USB link, I suspect wireless operation will
    usually not be the only mode for wireless USB devices.  (Plus, devices can
    recharge batteries using wired USB...)  All other key exchange protocols need
    error prone user interactions, like copying and/or verifying keys.
    
    It'll likely be a while before we have commercial Wireless USB hardware,
    much less Linux implementations that know how to use it.

    [PATCH] USB: ehci-hcd - fix page pointer allocation in itd_patch()
    
    The itd_patch() function is responsible for allocating entries in the
    buffer page pointer list of the iTD.  Particularly, a new page pointer
    is needed every time when buffer data crosses a page boundary.
    
    However, there is a bug in the allocation logic: the function does not
    allocate a new entry when the current transaction is the first
    transaction in the iTD (as indicated by first!=0).
    
    The consequence is that, when the data of the first transaction begins
    somewhere at the end of a page so that it actually does cross the page
    boundary, no new page pointer is allocated.  This means that the data
    at the end of the first transaction (beyond the page boundary) will be
    accessed by the HC using the second page pointer, which is zero.
    Furthermore, the first page pointer will be later overwritten by the
    page pointers of the other transactions, which will garble it because
    the value is or-ed into the iTD field.
    
    All this particular check (for !first) does is cause incorrect
    behaviour, so it should be entirely removed (and with it the variable
    first that is not used for anything else).

    [PATCH] USB UHCI: Detect invalid ports
    
    This patch changes the way uhci-hcd detects valid ports.  The
    specification doesn't mention any way to find out how many ports a
    controller has, so the driver has to use some heuristics, reading the port
    status and control register and deciding whether the value makes sense.
    With this patch the driver will recognize a typical failure mode (all bits
    set to one) for nonexistent ports and won't assume there are always at
    least 2 ports -- such an assumption seems silly if the heuristics have
    already shown that the ports don't exist.

    Rework the core usbatm code: minidrivers (i.e. drivers for particular

    usbnet.  At the same time, more common code from the speedtch and
    cxacru (patch 3/5) drivers was generalized and moved into the core.  The
    transmission and reception parts have been unified and simplified.  Since
    this is a major change and I don't like underscores in file names,
    usb_atm.[ch] has been renamed usbatm.[ch].

    [PATCH] USB: pxa2xx_udc updates
    
    This has several small updates to the px2xx UDC driver:
    
      * small fixes from Eugeny S. Mints <emints@ru.mvista.com>
         - local_irq_save() around potential endpoint disable race
         - fix handling of enqueue to OUT endpoints (potential oops)
      * add shutdown() method to disable any D+ pullup
      * rename methods accessing raw signals, referencing the signals
      * describes itself as for "pxa25x", since pxa27x is different

    This patch adds to the dummy_hcd driver a new routine for keeping track of
    all changes in the state of the emulated USB link.  The logic is now kept
    in one spot instead of spread around, and it's easier to verify and
    update the code.  The behavior of the port features has been corrected in
    a few respects as well (for instance, if the POWER feature is clear then
    none of the other features can be set).
    
    Also added is support for the (relatively new) _connect() and
    _disconnect() calls of the Gadget API.

    [PATCH] USB dummy_hcd: Partial OTG emulation
    
    Partial OTG support for dummy_hcd, mostly as a framework for further work.
    It emulates the new OTG flags in the host and peripheral frameworks, if
    that option is configured.  But it's incomplete:
    
      - Resetting the peripheral needs to clear the OTG state bits;
        a second enumeration won't work correctly.
    
      - This stops modeling HNP right when roles should switch the first time.
        It should probably disconnect, then set the usb_bus.is_b_host and
        usb_gadget.is_a_peripheral flags; then it'd enumerate almost normally,
        except for the role reversal.  Roles could then switch a second time,
        back to "normal" (with those flags cleared).
    
      - SRP should be modeled as "resume from port-unpowered", which is
        a state that usbcore doesn't yet use.
    
    HNP can be triggered by enabling the OTG whitelist and configuring a
    gadget driver that's not in that list; or by configuring Gadget Zero
    to identify itself as the HNP test device.

      * Handle transceiver setup more intelligently
          - use transceiver whenever one's available; this can be handy
            for GPIO based, loopback, or transceiverless configs

          - use 16 bit DMA access most of the time on TIPB
      * Add workarounds for some DMA errata (not observed "in the wild"):
          - DMA CSAC/CDAC reads returning zero
          - RX/TX DMA config registers bit 12 always reads as zero (TI patch)

      - Remove a needless wrapper around an RNDIS call
    
      - Improve and comment the status interrupt handling:
          * RNDIS sometimes needs to queue these transfers (rarely in normal
            cases, but reproducibly while Windows was deadlocking its USB stack)
          * Mark requests as busy/not

    [PATCH] usbcore support for root-hub IRQ instead of polling
    
    This is a revised version of an earlier patch to add support to usbcore
    for driving root hubs by interrupts rather than polling.
    
    There's a temporary flag added to struct usb_hcd, marking devices whose
    drivers are aware of the new mechanism.  By default that flag doesn't get
    set so drivers will continue to see the same polling behavior as before.
    This way we can convert the HCDs one by one to use interrupt-based event
    reporting, and the temporary flag can be removed when they're all done.
    
    Also included is a small change to the hcd_disable_endpoint routine.
    Although endpoints normally shouldn't be disabled while a controller is
    suspended, it's legal to do so when the controller's driver is being
    rmmod'ed.
    
    Lastly the patch adds a new callback, .hub_irq_enable, for use by HCDs
    where the root hub's port-change interrupts are level-triggered rather
    than edge-triggered.  The callback is invoked each time khubd has finished
    processing a root hub, to let the HCD know that the interrupt can safely
    be re-enabled.

    [PATCH] USB UHCI: improved reset handling
    
    This patch improves the strategy uhci-hcd uses for performing controller
    resets and checking whether they are needed.
    
    	The HCRESET command doesn't affect the Suspend, Resume,
    	or Reset bits in the port status & control registers, so

    [PATCH] USB UHCI: Use root-hub IRQs while suspended
    
    This patch, which has as478b as a prerequisite, enables the uhci-hcd
    driver to take advantage of root-hub IRQs rather than polling during the
    time it is suspended.  (Unfortunately the hardware doesn't support
    port-change interrupts while the controller is running.)  It also turns
    off the driver's private timer while the controller is suspended, as it
    isn't needed then.  The combined elimination of polling interrupts and
    timer interrupts ought to be enough to allow some systems to save a
    noticeable amount of power while they are otherwise idle.

    [PATCH] USB UHCI: Fix up loose ends
    
    This patch tidies up a few loose ends left by the preceding patches.
    It indicates the controller supports remote wakeup whenever the PM
    capability is present -- which shouldn't cause any harm if the
    assumption turns out to be wrong.  It refuses to suspend the
    controller if the root hub is still active, and it refuses to resume
    the root hub if the controller is suspended.  It adds checks for a
    dead controller in several spots, and it adds memory barriers as
    needed to insure that I/O operations are completed before moving on.
    
    Actually I'm not certain the last part is being done correctly.  With
    code like this:
    
    	outw(..., ...);
    	mb();
    	udelay(5);
    
    do we know for certain that the outw() will complete _before_ the
    delay begins?  If not, how should this be written?

    [PATCH] USB UHCI: Add root-hub suspend/resume support
    
    This patch implements (finally!) separate suspend and resume routines
    for the root hub and the controller in the UHCI driver.  It also
    changes the sequence used to reset the controller during initial
    probing, so as to preserve the existing state during a Resume-From-Disk.
    (This new sequence is what should be used in the PCI Quirks code for
    early USB handoffs, incidentally.)  Lastly it adds a notion of the
    controller being "inaccessible" while in a PCI low-power state, when
    normal I/O operations shouldn't be allowed.

    [PATCH] USB UHCI: Add root hub states
    
    This patch starts making some serious changes to the UHCI driver.
    There's a set of private states for the root hub, and the internal
    routines for suspending and resuming work completely differently, with
    transitions based on the new states.  Now the driver distinguishes
    between a privately auto-stopped state and a publicly suspended state,
    and it will properly suspend controllers with broken resume-detect
    interrupts instead of resetting them.

    This had been left as a soft error to give various user mode drivers a

    2.6.10 it would be changed.  It had been mostly safe as a soft error ...
    but that can not be guaranteed.  Now that a year has passed, it's time to
    really insist that the user mode drivers finally fix their relevant bugs.

     - runs usbtests 1-14 without problems for days.
     - has been in use by 6-7 different people on ARM and PPC platforms,
       running a range of devices including USB hubs.
     - supports suspend/resume of both the platform device and the root hub;
       supports remote wakeup of the root hub (but NOT the platform device)
       by USB devices.
     - does NOT support ISO transfers (nobody has asked for them).

      - OMAP 1710 doesn't have an internal transceiver.
    
      - Small PM update:  if the USB link is suspended, don't disconnect on
        entry to deep sleep.
    
      - Be more correct about handling zero length control reads.  OMAP
        seems to mis-handle that protocol peculiarity though; best avoided.
    
      - Platform device resources (for UDC and OTG controllers) now use
        physical addresses, so /proc/iomem is more consistent.
    
      - Minor cleanups, notably (by volume) for "sparse" NULL warnings.

    [PATCH] CFQ io scheduler updates
    
    - Adjust slice values
    
    - Instead of one async queue, one is defined per priority level. This
      prevents kernel threads (such as reiserfs/x and others) that run at
      higher io priority from conflicting with others. Previously, it was a
      coin toss what io prio the async queue got, it was defined by who
      first set up the queue.
    
    - Let a time slice only begin, when the previous slice is completely
      done. Previously we could be somewhat unfair to a new sync slice, if
      the previous slice was async and had several ios queued. This might
      need a little tweaking if throughput suffers a little due to this,
      allowing perhaps an overlap of a single request or so.
    
    - Optimize the calling of kblockd_schedule_work() by doing it only when
      it is strictly necessary (no requests in driver and work left to do).
    
    - Correct sync vs async logic. A 'normal' process can be purely async as
      well, and a flusher can be purely sync as well. Sync or async is now a
      property of the class defined and requests pending. Previously writers
      could be considered sync, when they were really async.
    
    - Get rid of the bit fields in cfqq and crq, use flags instead.
    
    - Various other cleanups and fixes

    [PATCH] Fix cfq_find_next_crq()
    
    In cfq_find_next_crq(), cfq tries to find the next request by choosing
    one of two requests before and after the current one.  Currently, when
    choosing the next request, if there's no next request, the next
    candidate is NULL, resulting in selection of the previous request.  This
    results in weird scheduling.  Once we reach the end, we always seek
    backward.
    
    The correct behavior is using the first request as the next candidate.
    cfq_choose_req() already has logics for handling wrapped requests.

    [PATCH] b44: check link state during open
    
    Check the link state during b44_open.  This closes a 1 HZ window
    that existed after b44_open ran but before the b44_timer handler ran,
    during which ethtool would report "Link detected: yes" no matter what
    the link state actually was.

    [PATCH] smc91x: plug race between TX tasklet and driver reset
    
    The race causes a kernel oops when smc_hardware_send_pkt() tries to
    dereference pending_tx_skb which would have been freed from one of the
    driver reset paths just after the tx_task tasklet has been scheduled.
    This race is possible on SMP but was uncovered by the kernel RT work.

    [PATCH] net/sb1000: replace nicedelay() with ssleep()
    
    Use ssleep() instead of nicedelay()
    to guarantee the task delays as expected. Remove the prototype and
    definition of nicedelay(). This is a very weird function, because it is
    called to sleep in terms of usecs, but always sleeps for 1 second,
    completely ignoring the parameter. I have gone ahead and followed suit,
    just sleeping for a second in all cases, but maybe someone with the
    hardware could tell me if perhaps the paramter *should* matter. Additionally,
    nicedelay() is called in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state, but doesn't deal with signals
    in case these longer delays do not complete, so I believe ssleep() is more
    appropriate.

    [IPVS]: Fix for overflows
    
    From: <pageexec@freemail.hu>
    
    $subject was fixed in 2.4 already, 2.6 needs it as well.
    
    The impact of the bugs is a kernel stack overflow and privilege escalation
    from CAP_NET_ADMIN via the IP_VS_SO_SET_STARTDAEMON/IP_VS_SO_GET_DAEMON
    ioctls.  People running with 'root=all caps' (i.e., most users) are not
    really affected (there's nothing to escalate), but SELinux and similar
    users should take it seriously if they grant CAP_NET_ADMIN to other users.

    [PATCH] defxx: Use irqreturn_t for the interrupt handler
    
    This is a fix for the interrupt handler in the defxx driver to use
    irqreturn_t.  Beside the obvious fix of returning a proper status at all,
    it actually checks board registers as appropriate for determining if an
    interrupt has been recorded in the bus-specific interface logic.
    
    The patch also includes an obvious one-line fix for SET_NETDEV_DEV needed
    for the EISA variation, for which I've decided there is no point in sending
    separately.

    [NETLINK]: Fix two socket hashing bugs.
    
    1) netlink_release() should only decrement the hash entry
       count if the socket was actually hashed.
    
       This was causing hash->entries to underflow, which
       resulting in all kinds of troubles.
    
       On 64-bit systems, this would cause the following
       conditional to erroneously trigger:
    
    	err = -ENOMEM;
    	if (BITS_PER_LONG > 32 && unlikely(hash->entries >= UINT_MAX))
    		goto err;
    
    2) netlink_autobind() needs to propagate the error return from
       netlink_insert().  Otherwise, callers will not see the error
       as they should and thus try to operate on a socket with a zero pid,
       which is very bad.
    
       However, it should not propagate -EBUSY.  If two threads race
       to autobind the socket, that is fine.  This is consistent with the
       autobind behavior in other protocols.
    
       So bug #1 above, combined with this one, resulted in hangs
       on netlink_sendmsg() calls to the rtnetlink socket.  We'd try
       to do the user sendmsg() with the socket's pid set to zero,
       later we do a socket lookup using that pid (via the value we
       stashed away in NETLINK_CB(skb).pid), but that won't give us the
       user socket, it will give us the rtnetlink socket.  So when we
       try to wake up the receive queue, we dive back into rtnetlink_rcv()
       which tries to recursively take the rtnetlink semaphore.
    
    Thanks to Jakub Jelink for providing backtraces.  Also, thanks to
    Herbert Xu for supplying debugging patches to help track this down,
    and also finding a mistake in an earlier version of this fix.

    [PATCH] pcnet_cs.c: IRQ handler optimization
    
    During some performance diagnostics I stumbled on this slightly wasteful
    code in pcnet_cs.c which I made the patch included at the bottom for (two
    minor comment fixes included).
    
    Improvement:
    instead of *always* calculating
    lea    0x2c0(%edx),%ebx
    and then additionally doing the
    mov    %edx,0xc0(%ebx)
    addition *if we need it*,
    
    we now do the *whole* calculation of
    mov    %edx,0x380(%ebx)
    *only* if we need it.
    This even manages to save us a whole 16-byte alignment buffer loss
    in this compilation case.
    
    Result: slightly improves IRQ handler performance in both shared and
    non-shared IRQ case, which should make my rusty P3/700 a slight bit happier.
    
    Thank you for your support,

    The spin loop in 8139cp is limited to 100 iterations when pulling hardware
    stats. There is no allowance for processor speed so on a fast machine, the
    stats may not be available that fast. Also, if the board doesn't return
    soon enough make sure turn the address back off to prevent later updates
    when memory has gone away.

    bonding: xor/802.3ad improved slave hash
    
    Add support for alternate slave selection algorithms to bonding
    balance-xor and 802.3ad modes.  Default mode (what we have now: xor of
    MAC addresses) is "layer2", new choice is "layer3+4", using IP and port
    information for hashing to select peer.
    
    Originally submitted by Jason Gabler for balance-xor mode;
    modified by Jay Vosburgh to additionally support 802.3ad mode.  Jason's
    original comment is as follows:
    
    The attached patch to the Linux Etherchannel Bonding driver modifies the
    driver's "balance-xor" mode as follows:
    
          - alternate hashing policy support for mode 2
            * Added kernel parameter "xmit_policy" to allow the specification
              of different hashing policies for mode 2.  The original mode 2
              policy is the default, now found in xmit_hash_policy_layer2().
            * Added xmit_hash_policy_layer34()
    
    This patch was inspired by hashing policies implemented by Cisco,
    Foundry and IBM, which are explained in
    Foundry documentation found at:

    [PATCH] ARM: 2753/1: move ixdp* cpld mappings
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    All ixdp platforms currently have a cpld mapped in at 0xfafff000.
    Since this address is not 1M-aligned, a regular page mapping will be
    used instead of a section mapping, which opens up the possibility of
    triggering ixp2400 erratum #66 as we only do the XCB=101 workaround
    thing for section mappings.
    There is still a lot of space higher up in the virtual memory map
    for 1M mappings, so move the cpld mapping to 0xfe000000 and make it
    1M big so that a section mapping will be used for it.

    NTFS: Fix a nasty deadlock that appeared in recent kernels.
          The situation: VFS inode X on a mounted ntfs volume is dirty.  For
          same inode X, the ntfs_inode is dirty and thus corresponding on-disk
          inode, i.e. mft record, which is in a dirty PAGE_CACHE_PAGE belonging
          to the table of inodes, i.e. $MFT, inode 0.
          What happens:
          Process 1: sys_sync()/umount()/whatever...  calls
          __sync_single_inode() for $MFT -> do_writepages() -> write_page for
          the dirty page containing the on-disk inode X, the page is now locked
          -> ntfs_write_mst_block() which clears PageUptodate() on the page to
          prevent anyone else getting hold of it whilst it does the write out.
          This is necessary as the on-disk inode needs "fixups" applied before
          the write to disk which are removed again after the write and
          PageUptodate is then set again.  It then analyses the page looking
          for dirty on-disk inodes and when it finds one it calls
          ntfs_may_write_mft_record() to see if it is safe to write this
          on-disk inode.  This then calls ilookup5() to check if the
          corresponding VFS inode is in icache().  This in turn calls ifind()
          which waits on the inode lock via wait_on_inode whilst holding the
          global inode_lock.
          Process 2: pdflush results in a call to __sync_single_inode for the
          same VFS inode X on the ntfs volume.  This locks the inode (I_LOCK)
          then calls write-inode -> ntfs_write_inode -> map_mft_record() ->
          read_cache_page() for the page (in page cache of table of inodes
          $MFT, inode 0) containing the on-disk inode.  This page has
          PageUptodate() clear because of Process 1 (see above) so
          read_cache_page() blocks when it tries to take the page lock for the
          page so it can call ntfs_read_page().
          Thus Process 1 is holding the page lock on the page containing the
          on-disk inode X and it is waiting on the inode X to be unlocked in
          ifind() so it can write the page out and then unlock the page.
          And Process 2 is holding the inode lock on inode X and is waiting for
          the page to be unlocked so it can call ntfs_readpage() or discover
          that Process 1 set PageUptodate() again and use the page.
          Thus we have a deadlock due to ifind() waiting on the inode lock.
          The solution: The fix is to use the newly introduced
          ilookup5_nowait() which does not wait on the inode's lock and hence
          avoids the deadlock.  This is safe as we do not care about the VFS
          inode and only use the fact that it is in the VFS inode cache and the
          fact that the vfs and ntfs inodes are one struct in memory to find
          the ntfs inode in memory if present.  Also, the ntfs inode has its
          own locking so it does not matter if the vfs inode is locked.

    scsi_add_host is the proper place to set the device, but people copy
    the scsi_set_device usage from older drivers again and again.
    
    note that this leaves some legacy drivers like qlogicisp/qlogicfc
    without pci association in sysfs, but they're scheduled to go away soon

    [PATCH] Cleanup patch for process freezing
    
    1. Establish a simple API for process freezing defined in linux/include/sched.h:
    
       frozen(process)		Check for frozen process
       freezing(process)		Check if a process is being frozen
       freeze(process)		Tell a process to freeze (go to refrigerator)
       thaw_process(process)	Restart process
       frozen_process(process)	Process is frozen now
    
    2. Remove all references to PF_FREEZE and PF_FROZEN from all
       kernel sources except sched.h
    
    3. Fix numerous locations where try_to_freeze is manually done by a driver
    
    4. Remove the argument that is no longer necessary from two function calls.
    
    5. Some whitespace cleanup
    
    6. Clear potential race in refrigerator (provides an open window of PF_FREEZE
       cleared before setting PF_FROZEN, recalc_sigpending does not check
       PF_FROZEN).
    
    This patch does not address the problem of freeze_processes() violating the rule
    that a task may only modify its own flags by setting PF_FREEZE. This is not clean
    in an SMP environment. freeze(process) is therefore not SMP safe!

    [PATCH] i386: cleanup boot_cpu_logical_apicid variables
    
    There are currently two different boot_cpu_logical_apicid variables:
    - a global one in mpparse.c
    - a static one in smpboot.c
    
    Of these two, only the one in smpboot.c might be used (through
    boot_cpu_apicid).
    
    This patch therefore removes the one in mpparse.c .

    [PATCH] change the SOUND_PRIME handling
    
    SOUND_PRIME (for OSS) is a tristate.
    
    This doesn't make much sense if most users are checking for
    SOUND_PRIME!=0.
    
    This patch changes the semantics of SOUND_PRIME to being a limit for all
    OSS modules, IOW: SOUND_PRIME=m does now say that all OSS drivers can
    only be modular.
    
    As a side effect, since SOUND_PRIME already depends on SOUND, there's no
    longer a reason for drivers depending on SOUND_PRIME to additionally
    depend on SOUND.

    [PATCH] remove redundant NULL checks before kfree() in sound/ and avoid casting pointers about to be kfree()'ed
    
    Checking a pointer for NULL before calling kfree() on it is redundant,
    kfree() deals with NULL pointers just fine.
    This patch removes such checks from sound/
    
    This patch also makes another, but closely related, change.
    It avoids casting pointers about to be kfree()'ed.

    [PATCH] char/ds1620: use msleep() instead of schedule_timeout()
    
    Not sure why any driver needs to sleep for *two* ticks, so let's fix it.
    
    Use msleep() instead of schedule_timeout() to guarantee the task delays as
    expected.  Signals are never checked for by the callers or in the function
    itself, so use TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE instead of TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE.  The
    delay is presumed to have been written when HZ==100, and thus has been
    multiplied by 10 to pass to msleep().

    [PATCH] kdump: Save trap information for later analysis
    
    If we are faulting in kernel it is quite possible this will lead to a
    panic.  Save trap number, cr2 (in case of page fault) and error_code in the
    current thread (these fields already exist for signal delivery but are not
    used here).
    
    This helps later kdump crash analyzing from user-space (a script has been
    submitted to dig this info out in gdb).

    [PATCH] kdump: Use real pt_regs from exception
    
    Makes kexec_crashdump() take a pt_regs * as an argument.  This allows to
    get exact register state at the point of the crash.  If we come from direct
    panic assertion NULL will be passed and the current registers saved before
    crashdump.
    
    This hooks into two places:
    die(): check the conditions under which we will panic when calling
    do_exit and go there directly with the pt_regs that caused the fatal
    fault.
    
    die_nmi(): If we receive an NMI lockup while in the kernel use the
    pt_regs and go directly to crash_kexec(). We're probably nested up badly
    at this point so this might be the only chance to escape with proper
    information.

    [PATCH] kdump: Documentation for Kdump
    
    This patch contains the documentation for the kexec based crash dump tool.
    
    Quick kdump-howto
    ================================================================
    
    1) Download and build kexec-tools.
    
    2) Download and build the latest kexec/kdump (-mm) kernel patchset.
       Two kernels need to be built in order to get this feature working.
    
      A) First kernel:
       a) Enable "kexec system call" feature:
    	CONFIG_KEXEC=y
       b) Physical load address (use default):
    	CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x100000
       c) Enable "sysfs file system support":
    	CONFIG_SYSFS=y
       d) Boot into first kernel with the command line parameter "crashkernel=Y@X":
          For example: "crashkernel=64M@16M".
    
      B) Second kernel:
       a) Enable "kernel crash dumps" feature:
    	CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP=y
       b) Physical load addreess, use same load address as X in "crashkernel"
          kernel parameter in d) above, e.g., 16 MB or 0x1000000.
    	CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x1000000
       c) Enable "/proc/vmcore support" (Optional, in Pseudo filesystems).
    	CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE=y
    
    3) Boot into the first kernel.
    
    4) Load the second kernel to be booted using:
    
       kexec -p <second-kernel> --crash-dump --args-linux --append="root=<root-dev>
       maxcpus=1 init 1"
    
    5) System reboots into the second kernel when a panic occurs. A module can be
       written to force the panic, for testing purposes.
    
    6) See Documentation/kdump.txt for how to read the first kernel's
       memory image and how to analyze it.

    [PATCH] Kexec: Kexec on panic fix with nmi watchdog enabled
    
    o Problem: Kexec on panic hangs if first kernel is booted with nmi_watchdog
      command line parameter. This problem occurs because kexec crash shutdown
      code replaces the NMI callback handler. This handler saves the cpu register
      states and halts the cpu. If system is booted with nmi_watchdog parameter,
      then crashing cpu also runs this nmi handler and halts itself.
    
    o This patch fixes the problem by keeping a track of crashing cpu and not
      executing the new nmi handler on crashing cpu.
    
    o There is a dependence on smp_processor_id() function which might return
      insane value for cpu, if cpu field of thread_info is corrupted.

    [PATCH] ppc64: kexec support for ppc64
    
    This patch implements the kexec support for ppc64 platforms.
    
    A couple of notes:
    
    1)  We copy the pages in virtual mode, using the full base kernel
        and a statically allocated stack.   At kexec_prepare time we
        scan the pages and if any overlap our (0, _end[]) range we
        return -ETXTBSY.
    
        On PowerPC 64 systems running in LPAR (logical partitioning)
        mode, only a small region of memory, referred to as the RMO,
        can be accessed in real mode.  Since Linux runs with only one
        zone of memory in the memory allocator, and it can be orders of
        magnitude more memory than the RMO, looping until we allocate
        pages in the source region is not feasible.  Copying in virtual
        means we don't have to write a hash table generation and call
        hypervisor to insert translations, instead we rely on the pinned
        kernel linear mapping.  The kernel already has move to linked
        location built in, so there is no requirement to load it at 0.
    
        If we want to load something other than a kernel, then a stub
        can be written to copy a linear chunk in real mode.
    
    2)  The start entry point gets passed parameters from the kernel.
        Slaves are started at a fixed address after copying code from
        the entry point.
    
        All CPUs get passed their firmware assigned physical id in r3
        (most calling conventions use this register for the first
        argument).
    
        This is used to distinguish each CPU from all other CPUs.
        Since firmware is not around, there is no other way to obtain
        this information other than to pass it somewhere.
    
        A single CPU, referred to here as the master and the one executing
        the kexec call, branches to start with the address of start in r4.
        While this can be calculated, we have to load it through a gpr to
        branch to this point so defining the register this is contained
        in is free.  A stack of unspecified size is available at r1
        (also common calling convention).
    
        All remaining running CPUs are sent to start at absolute address
        0x60 after copying the first 0x100 bytes from start to address 0.
        This convention was chosen because it matches what the kernel
        has been doing itself.  (only gpr3 is defined).
    
        Note: This is not quite the convention of the kexec bootblock v2
        in the kernel.  A stub has been written to convert between them,
        and we may adjust the kernel in the future to allow this directly
        without any stub.
    
    3)  Destination pages can be placed anywhere, even where they
        would not be accessible in real mode.  This will allow us to
        place ram disks above the RMO if we choose.

    [PATCH] kexec: kexec ppc support
    
    I have tweaked this patch slightly to handle an empty list
    of pages to relocate passed to relocate_new_kernel.  And
    I have added ppc_md.machine_crash_shutdown.  To keep up with
    the changes in the generic kexec infrastructure.
    
    From: Albert Herranz <albert_herranz@yahoo.es>
    
    The following patch adds support for kexec on the ppc32 platform.
    
    Non-OpenFirmware based platforms are likely to work directly without
    additional changes on the kernel side.  The kexec-tools userland package
    may need to be slightly updated, though.
    
    For OpenFirmware based machines, additional work is still needed on the
    kernel side before kexec support is ready.  Benjamin Herrenschmidt is
    kindly working on that part.
    
    In order for a ppc platform to use the kexec kernel services it must
    implement some ppc_md hooks.  Otherwise, kexec will be explicitly disabled,
    as suggested by benh.
    
    There are 3+1 new ppc_md hooks that a platform supporting kexec may
    implement.  Two of them are mandatory for kexec to work.  See
    include/asm-ppc/machdep.h for details.
    
    - machine_kexec_prepare(image)
    
      This function is called to make any arrangements to the image before it
      is loaded.
    
      This hook _MUST_ be provided by a platform in order to activate kexec
      support for that platform.  Otherwise, the platform is considered to not
      support kexec and the kexec_load system call will fail (that makes all
      existing platforms by default non-kexec'able).
    
    - machine_kexec_cleanup(image)
    
      This function is called to make any cleanups on image after the loaded
      image data it is freed.  This hook is optional.  A platform may or may
      not provide this hook.
    
    - machine_kexec(image)
    
      This function is called to perform the _actual_ kexec.  This hook
      _MUST_ be provided by a platform in order to activate kexec support for
      that platform.
    
      If a platform provides machine_kexec_prepare but forgets to provide
      machine_kexec, a kexec will fall back to a reboot.
    
      A ready-to-use machine_kexec_simple() generic function is provided to,
      hopefully, simplify kexec adoption for embedded platforms.  A platform
      may call this function from its specific machine_kexec hook, like this:
    
    void myplatform_kexec(struct kimage *image)
    {
            machine_kexec_simple(image);
    }
    
    - machine_shutdown()
    
      This function is called to perform any machine specific shutdowns, not
      already done by drivers.  This hook is optional.  A platform may or may
      not provide this hook.
    
    An example (trimmed) platform specific module for a platform supporting
    kexec through the existing machine_kexec_simple follows:
    
    /* ... */
    
    #ifdef CONFIG_KEXEC
    int myplatform_kexec_prepare(struct kimage *image)
    {
            /* here, we can place additional preparations
    */
            return 0; /* yes, we support kexec */
    }
    
    void myplatform_kexec(struct kimage *image)
    {

    [PATCH] crashdump: x86_64: crashkernel option
    
    This is the x86_64 implementation of the crashkernel option.  It reserves
    a window of memory very early in the bootup process, so we never use
    it for anything but the kernel to switch to when the running
    kernel panics.
    
    In addition to reserving this memory a resource structure is registered
    so looking at /proc/iomem it is clear what happened to that memory.
    
    ISSUES:
    Is it possible to implement this in a architecture generic way?
    What should be done with architectures that always use an iommu and
    thus don't report their RAM memory resources in /proc/iomem?

    [PATCH] kexec: x86 shutdown APICs during crash_shutdown
    
    In the case of a crash/panic an architecture specific function
    machine_crash_shutdown is called.  This patch adds to the x86 machine_crash
    function the standard kernel code for shutting down apics.
    
    Every line of code added to that function increases the risk that we will call
    code after a kernel panic that is not safe.
    
    This patch should not make it to the stable kernel without a being reviewed a
    lot more.  It is unclear how much a hardned kernel can take when it comes to
    misconfigured apics.  So since a normal kernel has problems this patch does a
    clean shutdown.
    
    It is my expectation this patch will be dropped from future generations of the
    kexec work.  But for the moment it is a crutch to keep from breaking
    everything.

    [PATCH] kexec: x86: snapshot registers during crash shutdown
    
    After the kernel panics if we wish to generate an entire machine core file it
    is very nice to know the register state at the time the machine crashed.
    
    After long discussion it was realized that if you are going to be saving the
    information anyway it is reasonable to store the information in a format that
    it will be used and recognized in so the register state is stored in the
    standard ELF note format.

    [PATCH] crashdump: x86: add NMI handler to capture other CPUs
    
    One of the dangers when switching from one kernel to another is what happens
    to all of the other cpus that were running in the crashed kernel.  In an
    attempt to avoid that problem this patch adds a nmi handler and attempts to
    shoot down the other cpus by sending them non maskable interrupts.
    
    The code then waits for 1 second or until all known cpus have stopped running
    and then jumps from the running kernel that has crashed to the kernel in
    reserved memory.
    
    The kernel spin loop is used for the delay as that should behave continue to
    be safe even in after a crash.

    [PATCH] Kexec on panic vmlinux initrd fix
    
    This is a minor bug fix in kexec to resolve the problem of loading panic
    kernel with initrd.
    
    o Problem: Loading a capture kenrel fails if initrd is also being loaded.
      This has been observed for vmlinux image for kexec on panic case.
    
    o This patch fixes the problem. In segment location and size verification
      logic, minor correction has been done. Segment memory end (mend) should be
      mstart + memsz - 1. This one byte offset was source of failure for initrd
      loading which was being loaded at hole boundary.

    In addition the hopefully architecture independent option

    the ramifications are before changing this value, and most users

    loaded at a different address as well you need to boot a vmlinux.

    This patch fixes a problem with reserving memory during boot up of a kernel

     But kernel can be built for non-default locatoin, hence existing

    [PATCH] sched: voluntary kernel preemption
    
    This patch adds a new preemption model: 'Voluntary Kernel Preemption'.  The
    3 models can be selected from a new menu:
    
                (X) No Forced Preemption (Server)
                ( ) Voluntary Kernel Preemption (Desktop)
                ( ) Preemptible Kernel (Low-Latency Desktop)
    
    we still default to the stock (Server) preemption model.
    
    Voluntary preemption works by adding a cond_resched()
    (reschedule-if-needed) call to every might_sleep() check.  It is lighter
    than CONFIG_PREEMPT - at the cost of not having as tight latencies.  It
    represents a different latency/complexity/overhead tradeoff.
    
    It has no runtime impact at all if disabled.  Here are size stats that show
    how the various preemption models impact the kernel's size:
    
        text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
     3618774  547184  179896 4345854  424ffe vmlinux.stock
     3626406  547184  179896 4353486  426dce vmlinux.voluntary   +0.2%
     3748414  548640  179896 4476950  445016 vmlinux.preempt     +3.5%
    
    voluntary-preempt is +0.2% of .text, preempt is +3.5%.
    
    This feature has been tested for many months by lots of people (and it's
    also included in the RHEL4 distribution and earlier variants were in Fedora
    as well), and it's intended for users and distributions who dont want to
    use full-blown CONFIG_PREEMPT for one reason or another.

    [PATCH] enable PREEMPT_BKL on !PREEMPT+SMP too
    
    The only sane way to clean up the current 3 lock_kernel() variants seems to
    be to remove the spinlock-based BKL implementations altogether, and to keep
    the semaphore-based one only.  If we dont want to do that for whatever
    reason then i'm afraid we have to live with the current complexity.  (but
    i'm open for other cleanup suggestions as well.)
    
    To explore this possibility we'll (at a minimum) have to know whether the
    semaphore-based BKL works fine on plain SMP too.  The patch below enables
    this.
    
    The patch may make sense in isolation as well, as it might bring
    performance benefits: code that would formerly spin on the BKL spinlock
    will now schedule away and give up the CPU.  It might introduce performance
    regressions as well, if any performance-critical code uses the BKL heavily
    and gets overscheduled due to the semaphore.  I very much hope there is no
    such performance-critical codepath left though.

    [PATCH] Dynamic sched domains: sched changes
    
    The following patches add dynamic sched domains functionality that was
    extensively discussed on lkml and lse-tech.  I would like to see this added to
    -mm
    
    o The main advantage with this feature is that it ensures that the scheduler
      load balacing code only balances against the cpus that are in the sched
      domain as defined by an exclusive cpuset and not all of the cpus in the
      system. This removes any overhead due to load balancing code trying to
      pull tasks outside of the cpu exclusive cpuset only to be prevented by
      the tasks' cpus_allowed mask.
    o cpu exclusive cpusets are useful for servers running orthogonal
      workloads such as RT applications requiring low latency and HPC
      applications that are throughput sensitive
    
    o It provides a new API partition_sched_domains in sched.c
      that makes dynamic sched domains possible.
    o cpu_exclusive cpusets sets are now associated with a sched domain.
      Which means that the users can dynamically modify the sched domains
      through the cpuset file system interface
    o ia64 sched domain code has been updated to support this feature as well
    o Currently, this does not support hotplug. (However some of my tests
      indicate hotplug+preempt is currently broken)
    o I have tested it extensively on x86.
    o This should have very minimal impact on performance as none of
      the fast paths are affected

    [PATCH] Changing RT priority without CAP_SYS_NICE
    
    Presently, a process without the capability CAP_SYS_NICE can not change
    its own policy, which is OK.
    
    But it can also not decrease its RT priority (if scheduled with policy
    SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO), which is what this patch changes.
    
    The rationale is the same as for the nice value: a process should be
    able to require less priority for itself. Increasing the priority is
    still not allowed.
    
    This is for example useful if you give a multithreaded user process a RT
    priority, and the process would like to organize its internal threads
    using priorities also. Then you can give the process the highest
    priority needed N, and the process starts its threads with lower
    priorities: N-1, N-2...
    
    The POSIX norm says that the permissions are implementation specific, so
    I think we can do that.
    
    In a sense, it makes the permissions consistent whatever the policy is:
    with this patch, process scheduled by SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR and
    SCHED_OTHER can all decrease their priority.

    [PATCH] sched: RCU domains
    
    One of the problems with the multilevel balance-on-fork/exec is that it needs
    to jump through hoops to satisfy sched-domain's locking semantics (that is,
    you may traverse your own domain when not preemptable, and you may traverse
    others' domains when holding their runqueue lock).
    
    balance-on-exec had to potentially migrate between more than one CPU before
    finding a final CPU to migrate to, and balance-on-fork needed to potentially
    take multiple runqueue locks.
    
    So bite the bullet and make sched-domains go completely RCU.  This actually
    simplifies the code quite a bit.

    [PATCH] sched: multilevel sbe sbf
    
    The fundamental problem that Suresh has with balance on exec and fork is that
    it only tries to balance the top level domain with the flag set.
    
    This was worked around by removing degenerate domains, but is still a problem
    if people want to start using more complex sched-domains, especially
    multilevel NUMA that ia64 is already using.
    
    This patch makes balance on fork and exec try balancing over not just the top
    most domain with the flag set, but all the way down the domain tree.

    [PATCH] sched: remove degenerate domains
    
    Remove degenerate scheduler domains during the sched-domain init.
    
    For example on x86_64, we always have NUMA configured in.  On Intel EM64T
    systems, top most sched domain will be of NUMA and with only one sched_group
    in it.
    
    With fork/exec balances(recent Nick's fixes in -mm tree), we always endup
    taking wrong decisions because of this topmost domain (as it contains only one
    group and find_idlest_group always returns NULL).  We will endup loading HT
    package completely first, letting active load balance kickin and correct it.
    
    In general, this patch also makes sense with out recent Nick's fixes in -mm.

    Modified to account for more than just sched_groups when scanning for

    Also replaces the "switch_lock" used by these architectures with an oncpu

    [PATCH] sched: balance on fork
    
    Reimplement the balance on exec balancing to be sched-domains aware.  Use this
    to also do balance on fork balancing.  Make x86_64 do balance on fork over the
    NUMA domain.
    
    The problem that the non sched domains aware blancing became apparent on dual
    core, multi socket opterons.  What we want is for the new tasks to be sent to
    a different socket, but more often than not, we would first load up our
    sibling core, or fill two cores of a single remote socket before selecting a
    new one.
    
    This gives large improvements to STREAM on such systems.

    [PATCH] sched: tweak affine wakeups
    
    Do less affine wakeups.  We're trying to reduce dbt2-pgsql idle time
    regressions here...  make sure we don't don't move tasks the wrong way in an
    imbalance condition.  Also, remove the cache coldness requirement from the
    calculation - this seems to induce sharp cutoff points where behaviour will
    suddenly change on some workloads if the load creeps slightly over or under
    some point.  It is good for periodic balancing because in that case have
    otherwise have no other context to determine what task to move.
    
    But also make a minor tweak to "wake balancing" - the imbalance tolerance is
    now set at half the domain's imbalance, so we get the opportunity to do wake
    balancing before the more random periodic rebalancing gets preformed.

    0 is instantaneous, idx > 0 returns a decaying average with the most recent
    sample weighted at 2^(idx-1).  To a maximum of 3 (could be easily increased).
    
    So generally a higher number will result in more conservative balancing.

    [PATCH] sched: less aggressive idle balancing
    
    Remove the special casing for idle CPU balancing.  Things like this are
    hurting for example on SMT, where are single sibling being idle doesn't really
    warrant a really aggressive pull over the NUMA domain, for example.

    [PATCH] sched: fix SMT scheduling problems
    
    SMT balancing has a couple of problems.  Firstly, active_load_balance is too
    complex - basically it should be a dumb helper for when the periodic balancer
    has determined there is an imbalance, but gets stuck because the task is
    running.
    
    So rip out all its "smarts", and just make it move one task to the target CPU.
    
    Second, the busy CPU's sched-domain tree was being used for active balancing.
    This means that it may not see that nr_balance_failed has reached a critical
    level.  So use the target CPU's sched-domain tree for this.  We can do this
    because we hold its runqueue lock.
    
    Lastly, reset nr_balance_failed to a point where we allow cache hot migration.
    This will help ensure active load balancing is successful.
    
    Thanks to Suresh Siddha for pointing out these issues.

    [PATCH] sched: improve load balancing pinned tasks
    
    John Hawkes explained the problem best:
    
    	A large number of processes that are pinned to a single CPU results
    	in every other CPU's load_balance() seeing this overloaded CPU as
    	"busiest", yet move_tasks() never finds a task to pull-migrate.  This
    	condition occurs during module unload, but can also occur as a
    	denial-of-service using sys_sched_setaffinity().  Several hundred
    	CPUs performing this fruitless load_balance() will livelock on the
    	busiest CPU's runqueue lock.  A smaller number of CPUs will livelock
    	if the pinned task count gets high.
    
    Expanding slightly on John's patch, this one attempts to work out whether the
    balancing failure has been due to too many tasks pinned on the runqueue.  This
    allows it to be basically invisible to the regular blancing paths (ie.  when
    there are no pinned tasks).  We can use this extra knowledge to shut down the
    balancing faster, and ensure the migration threads don't start running which
    is another problem observed in the wild.

    Basically, problem is generic_file_buffered_write() is accessing beyond end
    of the iov[] vector after handling the last vector.  If we happen to cross
    page boundary, we get a fault.
    
    I think this simple patch is good enough.  If we really don't want to

    [PATCH] RCU: clean up a few remaining synchronize_kernel() calls
    
    2.6.12-rc6-mm1 has a few remaining synchronize_kernel()s, some (but not
    all) in comments.  This patch changes these synchronize_kernel() calls (and
    comments) to synchronize_rcu() or synchronize_sched() as follows:
    
    - arch/x86_64/kernel/mce.c mce_read(): change to synchronize_sched() to
      handle races with machine-check exceptions (synchronize_rcu() would not cut
      it given RCU implementations intended for hardcore realtime use.
    
    - drivers/input/serio/i8042.c i8042_stop(): change to synchronize_sched() to
      handle races with i8042_interrupt() interrupt handler.  Again,
      synchronize_rcu() would not cut it given RCU implementations intended for
      hardcore realtime use.
    
    - include/*/kdebug.h comments: change to synchronize_sched() to handle races
      with NMIs.  As before, synchronize_rcu() would not cut it...
    
    - include/linux/list.h comment: change to synchronize_rcu(), since this
      comment is for list_del_rcu().
    
    - security/keys/key.c unregister_key_type(): change to synchronize_rcu(),
      since this is interacting with RCU read side.
    
    - security/keys/process_keys.c install_session_keyring(): change to
      synchronize_rcu(), since this is interacting with RCU read side.

    [PATCH] s390: debug feature changes
    
    This patch changes the memory allocation method for the s390 debug feature.
    Trace buffers had been allocated using the get_free_pages() function before.
    Therefore it was not possible to get big memory areas in a running system due
    to memory fragmentation.  Now the trace buffers are subdivided into several
    subbuffers with pagesize.  Therefore it is now possible to allocate more
    memory for the trace buffers and more trace records can be written.
    
    In addition to that, dynamic specification of the size of the trace buffers is
    implemented.  It is now possible to change the size of a trace buffer using a
    new debugfs file instance.  When writing a number into this file, the trace
    buffer size is changed to 'number * pagesize'.
    
    In the past all the traces could be obtained from userspace by accessing files
    in the "proc" filesystem.  Now with debugfs we have a new filesystem which
    should be used for debugging purposes.  This patch moves the debug feature
    from procfs to debugfs.
    
    Since the interface of debug_register() changed, all device drivers, which use
    the debug feature had to be adjusted.

    [PATCH] uml: fork cleanup
    
    Fix the do_fork calling convention: normal arch pass the regs and the new sp
    value to do_fork instead of NULL.
    
    Currently the arch-independent code ignores these values, while the UML code
    (actually it's copy_thread) gets the right values by itself.
    
    With this patch, things are fixed up.

    [PATCH] CPU hotplug printk fix
    
    In the cpu hotplug case, per-cpu data possibly isn't initialized even the
    system state is 'running'.  As the comments say in the original code, some
    console drivers assume per-cpu resources have been allocated.  radeon fb is
    one such driver, which uses kmalloc.  After a CPU is down, the per-cpu data
    of slab is freed, so the system crashed when printing some info.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Provide ability to choose using shortcuts for IPI in flat mode.
    
    This patch provides an option to switch broadcast or use mask version for
    sending IPI's.  If CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is defined, we choose not to use
    broadcast shortcuts by default, otherwise we choose broadcast mode as default.
    
    both cases, one can change this via startup cmd line option, to choose
    no-broadcast mode.
    
    	no_ipi_broadcast=1
    
    This is provided on request from Andi Kleen, since he doesnt agree with
    replacing IPI shortcuts as a solution for CPU hotplug.  Without removing
    broadcast IPI's, it would mean lots of new code for __cpu_up() path, which
    would acheive the same results.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Dont use broadcast shortcut to make it cpu hotplug safe.
    
    Broadcast IPI's provide un-expected behaviour for cpu hotplug.  CPU's in
    offline state also end up receiving the IPI.  Once the cpus become online they
    receive these stale IPI's which are bad and introduce unexpected behaviour.
    
    This is easily avoided by not sending a broadcast and addressing just the
    CPU's in online map.  Doing prelim cycle counts it appears there is no big
    overhead and numbers seem around 0x3000-0x3900 on an average on x86 and x86_64
    systems with CPUS running 3G, both for broadcast and mask version of the
    API's.
    
    The shortcuts are useful only for flat mode (where the perf shows no
    degradation), and in cluster mode, its unicast anyway.  Its simpler to just
    not use broadcast anymore.

    - Test with maxcpus=1, and then kick other cpu's off to test if init code
      is all cleaned up. CONFIG_SCHED_SMT works as well.
    - idle threads are forked on demand from keventd threads for clean startup
    
    TBD:
    1. Not tested on a real NUMA machine (tested with numa=fake=2)
    2. Handle ACPI pieces for physical hotplug support.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Change init sections for CPU hotplug support
    
    This patch adds __cpuinit and __cpuinitdata sections that need to exist past
    boot to support cpu hotplug.
    
    Caveat: This is done *only* for EM64T CPU Hotplug support, on request from
    Andi Kleen.  Much of the generic hotplug code in kernel, and none of the other
    archs that support CPU hotplug today, i386, ia64, ppc64, s390 and parisc dont
    mark sections with __cpuinit, but only mark them as __devinit, and
    __devinitdata.
    
    If someone is motivated to change generic code, we need to make sure all
    existing hotplug code does not break, on other arch's that dont use __cpuinit,
    and __cpudevinit.

    [PATCH] i386: Dont use IPI broadcast when using cpu hotplug.
    
    This patch introduces a startup parameter no_broadcast.  When we enable
    CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, we dont want to use broadcast shortcut as it has ill
    effects on a offline cpu.  If we issue broadcast, the IPI is also delivered
    to offline cpus, or partially up cpu causing stale IPI's to be handled,
    which is a problem and can cause undesirable effects.
    
    Introduces a new startup cmdline option no_ipi_broadcast, that can be
    switched at cmdline if necessary.

    [PATCH] i386 CPU hotplug
    
    (The i386 CPU hotplug patch provides infrastructure for some work which Pavel
    is doing as well as for ACPI S3 (suspend-to-RAM) work which Li Shaohua
    <shaohua.li@intel.com> is doing)
    
    The following provides i386 architecture support for safely unregistering and
    registering processors during runtime, updated for the current -mm tree.  In
    order to avoid dumping cpu hotplug code into kernel/irq/* i dropped the
    cpu_online check in do_IRQ() by modifying fixup_irqs().  The difference being
    that on cpu offline, fixup_irqs() is called before we clear the cpu from
    cpu_online_map and a long delay in order to ensure that we never have any
    queued external interrupts on the APICs.  There are additional changes to s390
    and ppc64 to account for this change.
    
    1) Add CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
    2) disable local APIC timer on dead cpus.
    3) Disable preempt around irq balancing to prevent CPUs going down.
    4) Print irq stats for all possible cpus.
    5) Debugging check for interrupts on offline cpus.
    6) Hacky fixup_irqs() to redirect irqs when cpus go off/online.
    7) play_dead() for offline cpus to spin inside.
    8) Handle offline cpus set in flush_tlb_others().
    9) Grab lock earlier in smp_call_function() to prevent CPUs going down.
    10) Implement __cpu_disable() and __cpu_die().
    11) Enable local interrupts in cpu_enable() after fixup_irqs()
    12) Don't fiddle with NMI on dead cpu, but leave intact on other cpus.
    13) Program IRQ affinity whilst cpu is still in cpu_online_map on offline.

    [PATCH] selinux: add executable heap check
    
    This patch,based on sample code by Roland McGrath, adds an execheap
    permission check that controls the ability to make the heap executable so
    that this can be prevented in almost all cases (the X server is presently
    an exception, but this will hopefully be resolved in the future) so that
    even programs with execmem permission will need to have the anonymous
    memory mapped in order to make it executable.
    
    The only reason that we use a permission check for such restriction (vs.
    making it unconditional) is that the X module loader presently needs it; it
    could possibly be made unconditional in the future when X is changed.
    
    The policy patch for the execheap permission is available at:

    [PATCH] selinux: add executable stack check
    
    This patch adds an execstack permission check that controls the ability to
    make the main process stack executable so that attempts to make the stack
    executable can still be prevented even if the process is allowed the
    existing execmem permission in order to e.g.  perform runtime code
    generation.  Note that this does not yet address thread stacks.  Note also
    that unlike the execmem check, the execstack check is only applied on
    mprotect calls, not mmap calls, as the current security_file_mmap hook is
    not passed the necessary information presently.
    
    The original author of the code that makes the distinction of the stack
    region, is Ingo Molnar, who wrote it within his patch for
    /proc/<pid>/maps markers.
    (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110719881508591&w=2)
    
    The patches also can be found at:
    http://pearls.tuxedo-es.org/patches/selinux/policy-execstack.patch
    http://pearls.tuxedo-es.org/patches/selinux/kernel-execstack.patch
    
    policy-execstack.patch is the patch that needs to be applied to the policy in
    order to support the execstack permission and exclude it
    from general_domain_access within macros/core_macros.te.
    
    kernel-execstack.patch adds such permission to the SELinux code within
    the kernel and adds the proper permission check to the selinux_file_mprotect() hook.

    [PATCH] ARM: Generic Dynamic Tick Timer support for ARM, take 4
    
    This patch adds support for Dynamic Tick Timer for ARM. Dynamic Tick is
    also known as VST (Variable Scheduling Timeouts).
    
    Dynamic Tick has been in use in the OMAP tree since last October.  The
    patch is not intrusive, and does not do anything unless CONFIG_NO_IDLE_HZ
    is defined.  This patch has the following fixed based on comments from
    RMK:
    - Time is updated before calling interrupt handlers.
    - Added new interrupt flag SA_TIMER to avoid duplicate timer interrupts
    - Moved struct dyn_tick_timer to time.h until we at some point probably
      have an arch independent dyn-tick.h
    - Cleaned up testing for DYN_TICK_ENABLED in irq.c
    
     I've cleaned up this patch to fix some remaining issues:
     - Call the timer tick handler with irqs disabled, as it would be from
       a normal interrupt
     - if we have a dyn_tick, we better implement all methods.
     - generic timer_dyn_reprogram() call, to be called before sleeping
     - added command line option - "dyntick=" to allow boot-time control
       of this feature

    [PATCH] ARM: 2752/1: disable ixp2000 PCI I/O software workaround on chips that don't need it
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    The later ixp2000 models don't need the PCI I/O workaround that we
    currently perform.  Add a config option to disable the workaround,
    and panic on boot if a kernel without the workaround is booted on a
    buggy chip.  As only pre-production ixp2000s need the workaround,
    the default is for it not to be configured in.

    [TG3]: Refinements to new locking strategy.
    
    1. Move tp->irq_sync = 0 to before the interrupt mailbox IO in

       irq_sync == 0 when interrupts are enabled.
    
    2. Remove the tg3_enable_ints() call in tg3_reset_hw(). Interrupts are
       always enabled explicitly or through tg3_netif_start(). This is to
       prevent interrupts being enabled while poll is disabled.
    
    3. Update trans_start with jiffies in tg3_netif_stop() to prevent false
       NETDEV WATCHDOG.
    
    4. Pass in the proper irq_sync parameter to tg3_full_lock() depending on

    [TG3]: Eliminate all hw IRQ handler spinlocks.
    
    Move all driver spinlocks to be taken at sw IRQ
    context only.
    
    This fixes the skb_copy() we were doing with hw
    IRQs disabled (which is illegal and triggers a
    BUG() with HIGHMEM enabled).  It also simplifies
    the locking all over the driver tremendously.
    
    We accomplish this feat by creating a special
    sequence to synchronize with the hw IRQ handler
    using a binary state and synchronize_irq().
    This idea is from Herbert Xu.

    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    This patch cleans up the ixp2000 gpio irq code and implements the
    set_irq_type method for gpio irqs so that users can select for which
    events (falling edge/rising edge/level low/level high) on the gpio
    pin they want the corresponding gpio irq to be triggered.

    [PATCH] ARM: 2740/1: ixp2000 align{b,w} need to parenthesize their arguments
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    Two macros that are used on the ixp2000 to fixup byte lane enables
    for I/O space accesses, align{b,w}, use their arguments without

    Add "memory" clobbers to the x86 inline asm of strncmp and friends
    
    They don't actually clobber memory, but gcc doesn't even know they
    _read_ memory, so can apparently re-order memory accesses around them.
    
    Which obviously does the wrong thing if the memory access happens to
    change the memory that the compare function is accessing..
    
    Verified to fix a strange boot problem by Jens Axboe.

    [PATCH] xip: reduce code duplication
    
    This patch reworks filemap_xip.c with the goal to reduce code duplication
    from mm/filemap.c.  It applies agains 2.6.12-rc6-mm1.  Instead of
    implementing the aio functions, this one implements the synchronous
    read/write functions only.  For readv and writev, the generic fallback is
    used.  For aio, we rely on the application doing the fallback.  Since our
    "synchronous" function does memcpy immediately anyway, there is no
    performance difference between using the fallbacks or implementing each
    operation.

    - generic_file* file operations do no longer have a xip/non-xip split
    - filemap_xip.c implements a new set of fops that require get_xip_page
      aop to work proper. all new fops are exported GPL-only (don't like to
      see whatever code use those except GPL modules)
    - __xip_unmap now uses page_check_address, which is no longer static
      in rmap.c, and defined in linux/rmap.h
    - mm/filemap.h is now much more clean, plainly having just Linus'
      inline funcs moved here from filemap.c
    - fix includes in filemap_xip to make it build cleanly on i386

    [PATCH] modules: add version and srcversion to sysfs
    
    This patch adds version and srcversion files to
    /sys/module/${modulename} containing the version and srcversion fields
    of the module's modinfo section (if present).
    
    /sys/module/e1000
    |-- srcversion
    `-- version
    
    This patch differs slightly from the version posted in January, as it
    now uses the new kstrdup() call in -mm.
    
    Why put this in sysfs?
    
    a) Tools like DKMS, which deal with changing out individual kernel
       modules without replacing the whole kernel, can behave smarter if they
       can tell the version of a given module.  The autoinstaller feature, for
       example, which determines if your system has a "good" version of a
       driver (i.e.  if the one provided by DKMS has a newer verson than that
       provided by the kernel package installed), and to automatically compile
       and install a newer version if DKMS has it but your kernel doesn't yet
       have that version.
    
    b) Because sysadmins manually, or with tools like DKMS, can switch out
       modules on the file system, you can't count on 'modinfo foo.ko', which
       looks at /lib/modules/${kernelver}/...  actually matching what is loaded
       into the kernel already.  Hence asking sysfs for this.
    
    c) as the unbind-driver-from-device work takes shape, it will be
       possible to rebind a driver that's built-in (no .ko to modinfo for the
       version) to a newly loaded module.  sysfs will have the
       currently-built-in version info, for comparison.
    
    d) tech support scripts can then easily grab the version info for what's
       running presently - a question I get often.
    
    There has been renewed interest in this patch on linux-scsi by driver
    authors.
    
    As the idea originated from GregKH, I leave his Signed-off-by: intact,
    though the implementation is nearly completely new.  Compiled and run on
    x86 and x86_64.

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: initialize recovery directory
    
    NFSv4 clients are required to know what state they have on the server so that
    they can reclaim it on server reboot.  However, it is possible for
    pathalogical combinations of server reboots and network partitions to leave a
    client in a state where it cannot know whether it has lost its state on the
    server.
    
    For this reason, rfc3530 requires that we store some information about clients
    to stable storage.
    
    So we maintain a directory /var/lib/nfs/v4recovery with a subdirectory for
    each client with active state.  We leave open the possibility of including
    files underneath each such subdirectory with information about the client, but
    for now the subdirectories are empty.
    
    We create a client subdirectory whenever a client makes its first non-reclaim
    open_confirm.
    
    We remove a client subdirectory whenever either
            a) its lease expires, or
    	b) the grace period ends without it reclaiming anything.
    When handling reclaims, we allow the reclaim if and only if the client doing
    the reclaim has a subdirectory.
    
    This patch adds just the code to scan the recovery directory on nfsd startup.

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: remove cb_parsed
    
    The cb_parsed field is only used by probe_callback, to determine whether the
    callback information has been filled in by setclientid.  But there is no way
    that probe_callback() can be called without that having already happened, so
    that check is superfluous, as is cb_parsed.

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: allow multiple lockowners
    
    >From the language of rfc3530 section 8.1.3 (e.g., the suggestion that a
    "process id" might be a reasonable lockowner value) it's conceivable that a
    client might want to use the same lockowner string on multiple files, so we may
    as well allow that.  We expect each use of open_to_lockowner to create a
    distinct seqid stream, though.
    
    For now we're also allowing multiple uses of open_to_lockowner with the same
    open, though it seems unlikely clients would actually do that.
    
    Also add a comment reminding myself of some very non-scalable data structures.

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: rename state list fields
    
    Trivial renaming patch:
    
    I can never remember, while looking at various lists relating the nfsd4 state
    structures, which are the "heads" and which are items on other lists, or which
    structures are actually on the various lists.  The following convention helps
    me: given structures foo and bar, with foo containing the head of a list of
    bars, use "bars" for the name of the head of the list contained in the struct
    foo, and use "per_foo" for the entries in the struct bars.
    
    Already done for struct nfs4_file; go ahead and do it for the other nfsd4
    state structures.

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: grace period end
    
    For the purposes of reboot recovery, we want to do some work during the
    transition period at the end of the grace period.  Some of that work must be
    guaranteed to have a certain relationship with the end of the grace period, so
    we want to control the transition there.
    
    Our approach is to modify the in_grace() checks to consult a global variable
    instead of checking the time directly, to schedule the first run of the
    laundromat thread at the end of the grace period, and to set the global
    end-of-grace-period there.

    are md5 collisions, then we'll return clid_inuse to the second.

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: simplify lease changing
    
    The only way the protocol gives to change the lease time on the fly is to
    simulate a reboot.  We don't have that completely right in the current code;
    among other things, we should probably put lockd in grace too while we do
    this.
    
    For now, let's just keep this simple, and wait till the next time nfsd starts
    to register any changes in lease time.  If the administrator really wants to
    change the lease time *now*, they can go ahead and bring nfsd down and then
    back up again after changing the lease time.
    
    Also remove the "if (reclaim_str_hashtbl_size == 0)" case, a shortcut which
    skips the grace period if we know of no clients in need of recovery.  This
    isn't going to work well with nlm.

    [PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: fix probe_callback
    
    rpc_create_client was modified recently to do its own (synchronous) NULL ping
    of the server.  We'd rather do that on our own, asynchronously, so that we
    don't have to block the nfsd thread doing the probe, and so that setclientid
    handling (hence, client mounts) can proceed normally whether the callback is
    succesful or not.  (We can still function fine without the callback
    channel--we just won't be able to give out delegations till it's verified to
    work.)

    [PATCH] nfsd4: reference count struct nfs4_file
    
    Add a struct kref to each nfs4_file and take a reference to it from each
    stateid and delegation that refers to it.  The atomicity guarantees are
    overkill given that all this stuff is done under the single nfsd4 state lock,
    but a) we'd like finer-grained locking some day, and b) this simplifies the
    cleanup of the structures a bit, something that has previously been a bit
    complicated and bug-prone.

    [PATCH] nfsd4: rename nfs4_file fields
    
    Trivial renaming patch:
    
    I can never remember, while looking at various lists relating the nfsd4 state
    structures, which are the "heads" and which are items on other lists, or which
    structures are actually on the various lists.  The following convention helps
    me: given structures foo and bar, with foo containing the head of a list of
    bars, use "bars" for the name of the head of the list contained in the struct
    foo, and use "per_foo" for the entries in the struct bars.
    
    Go ahead and do this for struct nfs4_file.

    [PATCH] nfsd4: slabify nfs4_files
    
    The structures the server uses to keep track of various pieces of nfsv4 state
    (open files, outstanding delegations, etc.) are likely to be allocated and
    deallocated frequently and seem reasonable candidates for slab caches.
    
    While we're at it, the slab code keeps statistics that help catch leaks and
    such, so we may as well take this chance to eliminate some debugging counters
    that we've been keeping ourselves.
    
    Start with the struct nfs4_file.

    [PATCH] nfsd4: block metadata ops during grace period
    
    We currently return err_grace if a user attempts a non-reclaim open during the
    grace period.  But we also need to prevent renames and removes, at least, to
    ensure clients have the chance to recover state on files before they are moved
    or deleted.
    
    Of course, local users could also do renames and removes during the lease
    period, and there's not much we can do about that.  This at least will help
    with remote users.

    [PATCH] nfsd4: fix fh_expire_type
    
    We're returning NFS4_FH_NOEXPIRE_WITH_OPEN | NFS4_FH_VOL_RENAME for the
    fh_expire_type attribute.  This is incorrect:
    	1. The spec actually only allows NOEXPIRE_WITH_OPEN when
    	   VOLATILE_ANY is also set.
    	2. Filehandles for open files can expire, if the file is removed
    	   and there is a reboot.
    	3. Filehandles are only volatile on rename in the nosubtree check
    	   case.
    
    Unfortunately, there's no way to indicate that we only expire on remove.  So
    our only choice is FH4_VOLATILE_ANY.  Although it's redundant, we also set
    FH4_VOL_RENAME in the subtree check case, since subtreecheck does actually
    cause problems in practice and it seems possibly useful to give clients some
    way to distinguish that case.
    
    Fix a mispelled #define while we're at it.

    As this changes the format, an upgrade to the just-released 0.9 release of

    - There is a new i2c command (TUNER_SET_ADDR) to allow tuner clients to
      select I2C address for FM or TV tuner;
    
    - Tuner I2C dettach now generates a warning on syslog if failed.

    - TVision TVF-8531MF and TVF-5533 MF tuner included.  It uses, by
      default, I2C on 0xC2 address for TV and on 0xC0 for Radio.  Both TV and
      FM Radio mode are working.

    callbacks are probably broken (and generate a warning along the lines
    of "assignment from incompatible pointer type").

    [PATCH] I2O: Adaptec specific SG_IO access, firmware access through sysfs and 2400A workaround
    
    Changes:
     - Provide SG_IO access to BLOCK and EXECUTIVE class on Adaptec
       controllers
     - Use PRIVATE messages in SCSI-OSM because on some controllers normal
       SCSI class commands like READ or READ CAPACITY cause errors
     - Use new DMA and SG list creation function
     - Added workaround to limit sectors per request for Adaptec 2400A
       controllers

    [PATCH] I2O: new sysfs attributes and Adaptec specific block device access and 64-bit DMA support
    
    Changes:
     - Added Bus-OSM which could be used by user space programs to reset a
       channel on the controller
     - Make ioctl's in Config-OSM obsolete in prefer for sysfs attributes and
       move those to its own file
     - Added sysfs attribute for firmware read and write access for I2O
       controllers
     - Added special handling of firmware read and write access for Adaptec
       controllers
     - Added vendor id and product id as sysfs-attribute to Executive classes
     - Added automatic notification of LCT change handling to Exec-OSM
     - Added flushing function to Block-OSM for later barrier implementation
     - Use PRIVATE messages for Block access on Adaptec controllers, which are
       faster then BLOCK class access
     - Cleaned up support for Promise controller
     - New messages are now detected using the IRQ status register as
       suggested by the I2O spec
     - Added i2o_dma_high() and i2o_dma_low() functions
     - Added facility for SG tablesize calculation when using 32-bit and
       64-bit DMA addresses
     - Added i2o_dma_map_single() and i2o_dma_map_sg() which could build the
       SG list for 32-bit as well as 64-bit DMA addresses

    [PATCH] tpm: improve output in sysfs files when the TPM fails
    
    Since after reconsideration this is more debug output than an error (the
    TPM is operating correctly given the current state) I have changed the
    statements to dbg rather than err.
    
    Also this patch corrects a memory leak if the error path is taken in the
    tpm_show_pubek function.

    [PATCH] char/tpm: use msleep(), clean-up timers,
    
    The TPM driver unnecessarily uses timers when it simply needs to maintain a
    maximum delay via time_before().  msleep() is used instead of
    schedule_timeout() to guarantee the task delays as expected.  While
    compile-testing, I found a typo in the driver, using tpm_chp instead of
    tpm_chip.  Remove the now unused timer callback function and change
    TPM_TIMEOUT's units to milliseconds.  Patch is compile-tested.

    [PATCH] ipmi: add power cycle capability
    
    This patch to adds "power cycle" functionality to the IPMI power off module
    ipmi_poweroff.  It also contains changes to support procfs control of the
    feature.
    
    The power cycle action is considered an optional chassis control in the IPMI
    specification.  However, it is definitely useful when the hardware supports
    it.  A power cycle is usually required in order to reset a firmware in a bad
    state.  This action is critical to allow remote management of servers.
    
    The implementation adds power cycle as optional to the ipmi_poweroff module.
    It can be modified dynamically through the proc entry mentioned above.  During
    a power down and enabled, the power cycle command is sent to the BMC firmware.
     If it fails either due to non-support or some error, it will retry to send
    the command as power off.

    [PATCH] xtensa: Tensilica Xtensa CPU arch maintainer record
    
    Start of a patch series which adds support for the xtensa architecture to
    Linux.
    
    The Xtensa architecture is highly configurable and usually buried inside an
    SOC device.  So, if you buy a new printer, digital camera, or cell phone,
    there is a chance that there is an Xtensa inside even though you don't know it
    (sometimes as a small audio-engine or as a control CPU).  Linux hasn't been
    adopted widely with Xtensa yet, but with Linux growing in the embedded space,
    I am sure it will become much more important.
    
    The attached patch supplies the maintainer record for an architecture
    implementation for the Tensilica Xtensa CPU series.

    [PATCH] Keys: Make request-key create an authorisation key
    
    The attached patch makes the following changes:
    
     (1) There's a new special key type called ".request_key_auth".
    
         This is an authorisation key for when one process requests a key and
         another process is started to construct it. This type of key cannot be
         created by the user; nor can it be requested by kernel services.
    
         Authorisation keys hold two references:
    
         (a) Each refers to a key being constructed. When the key being
         	 constructed is instantiated the authorisation key is revoked,
         	 rendering it of no further use.
    
         (b) The "authorising process". This is either:
    
         	 (i) the process that called request_key(), or:
    
         	 (ii) if the process that called request_key() itself had an
         	      authorisation key in its session keyring, then the authorising
         	      process referred to by that authorisation key will also be
         	      referred to by the new authorisation key.
    
    	 This means that the process that initiated a chain of key requests
    	 will authorise the lot of them, and will, by default, wind up with
    	 the keys obtained from them in its keyrings.
    
     (2) request_key() creates an authorisation key which is then passed to
         /sbin/request-key in as part of a new session keyring.
    
     (3) When request_key() is searching for a key to hand back to the caller, if
         it comes across an authorisation key in the session keyring of the
         calling process, it will also search the keyrings of the process
         specified therein and it will use the specified process's credentials
         (fsuid, fsgid, groups) to do that rather than the calling process's
         credentials.
    
         This allows a process started by /sbin/request-key to find keys belonging
         to the authorising process.
    
     (4) A key can be read, even if the process executing KEYCTL_READ doesn't have
         direct read or search permission if that key is contained within the
         keyrings of a process specified by an authorisation key found within the
         calling process's session keyring, and is searchable using the
         credentials of the authorising process.
    
         This allows a process started by /sbin/request-key to read keys belonging
         to the authorising process.
    
     (5) The magic KEY_SPEC_*_KEYRING key IDs when passed to KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE or
         KEYCTL_NEGATE will specify a keyring of the authorising process, rather
         than the process doing the instantiation.
    
     (6) One of the process keyrings can be nominated as the default to which
         request_key() should attach new keys if not otherwise specified. This is
         done with KEYCTL_SET_REQKEY_KEYRING and one of the KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_*
         constants. The current setting can also be read using this call.
    
     (7) request_key() is partially interruptible. If it is waiting for another
         process to finish constructing a key, it can be interrupted. This permits
         a request-key cycle to be broken without recourse to rebooting.

    [PATCH] Keys: Use RCU to manage session keyring pointer
    
    The attached patch uses RCU to manage the session keyring pointer in struct
    signal_struct.  This means that searching need not disable interrupts and get
    a the sighand spinlock to access this pointer.  Furthermore, by judicious use
    of rcu_read_(un)lock(), this patch also avoids the need to take and put
    refcounts on the session keyring itself, thus saving on even more atomic ops.

    [PATCH] keys: Discard key spinlock and use RCU for key payload
    
    The attached patch changes the key implementation in a number of ways:
    
     (1) It removes the spinlock from the key structure.
    
     (2) The key flags are now accessed using atomic bitops instead of
         write-locking the key spinlock and using C bitwise operators.
    
         The three instantiation flags are dealt with with the construction
         semaphore held during the request_key/instantiate/negate sequence, thus
         rendering the spinlock superfluous.
    
         The key flags are also now bit numbers not bit masks.
    
     (3) The key payload is now accessed using RCU. This permits the recursive
         keyring search algorithm to be simplified greatly since no locks need be
         taken other than the usual RCU preemption disablement. Searching now does
         not require any locks or semaphores to be held; merely that the starting
         keyring be pinned.
    
     (4) The keyring payload now includes an RCU head so that it can be disposed
         of by call_rcu(). This requires that the payload be copied on unlink to
         prevent introducing races in copy-down vs search-up.
    
     (5) The user key payload is now a structure with the data following it. It
         includes an RCU head like the keyring payload and for the same reason. It
         also contains a data length because the data length in the key may be
         changed on another CPU whilst an RCU protected read is in progress on the
         payload. This would then see the supposed RCU payload and the on-key data
         length getting out of sync.
    
         I'm tempted to drop the key's datalen entirely, except that it's used in
         conjunction with quota management and so is a little tricky to get rid
         of.
    
     (6) Update the keys documentation.

    [LIB]: Naive finite state machine based textsearch
    
    A finite state machine consists of n states (struct ts_fsm_token)
    representing the pattern as a finite automation. The data is read
    sequentially on a octet basis. Every state token specifies the number
    of recurrences and the type of value accepted which can be either a
    specific character or ctype based set of characters. The available
    type of recurrences include 1, (0|1), [0 n], and [1 n].
    
    The algorithm differs between strict/non-strict mode specyfing
    whether the pattern has to start at the first octect. Strict mode
    is enabled by default and can be disabled by inserting
    TS_FSM_HEAD_IGNORE as the first token in the chain.
    
    The runtime performance of the algorithm should be around O(n),
    however while in strict mode the average runtime can be better.

    [LIB]: Knuth-Morris-Pratt textsearch algorithm
    
    Implements a linear-time string-matching algorithm due to Knuth,
    Morris, and Pratt [1]. Their algorithm avoids the explicit
    computation of the transition function DELTA altogether. Its
    matching time is O(n), for n being length(text), using just an
    auxiliary function PI[1..m], for m being length(pattern),
    precomputed from the pattern in time O(m). The array PI allows
    the transition function DELTA to be computed efficiently
    "on the fly" as needed. Roughly speaking, for any state
    "q" = 0,1,...,m and any character "a" in SIGMA, the value
    PI["q"] contains the information that is independent of "a" and
    is needed to compute DELTA("q", "a") [2]. Since the array PI
    has only m entries, whereas DELTA has O(m|SIGMA|) entries, we
    save a factor of |SIGMA| in the preprocessing time by computing
    PI rather than DELTA.

    [NET]: Eliminate netif_rx massive packet drops.
    
    Eliminate the throttling behaviour when the netif receive queue fills
    because it behaves badly when using high speed networks under load.
    The throttling cause multiple packet drops that cause TCP to go into
    slow start mode. The same effective patch has been part of BIC TCP and
    H-TCP as well as part of Web100.
    
    The existing code drops 100's of packets when the queue fills;
    this changes it to individual packet drop-tail.

    [NET]: Remove obsolete netif_rx congestion sensing mechanism.
    
    Remove the congestion sensing mechanism from netif_rx, and always
    return either full or empty.  Almost no driver checks the return value
    from netif_rx, and those that do only use it for debug messages.
    
    The original design of netif_rx was to do flow control based on the
    receive queue, but NAPI has supplanted this and no driver uses the
    feedback.

    [TCP]: Add H-TCP congestion control module.
    
    H-TCP is a congestion control algorithm developed at the Hamilton Institute, by
    Douglas Leith and Robert Shorten. It is extending the standard Reno algorithm
    with mode switching is thus a relatively simple modification.
    
    H-TCP is defined in a layered manner as it is still a research platform. The
    basic form includes the modification of beta according to the ratio of maxRTT
    to min RTT and the alpha=2*factor*(1-beta) relation, where factor is dependant
    on the time since last congestion.
    
    The other layers improve convergence by adding appropriate factors to alpha.
    
    The following patch implements the H-TCP algorithm in it's basic form.

    - "In heterogeneous networks, TCP connections that incorporate a

    respect to entirely wired connections, because of their longer round
    trip times (RTTs). To cope with this problem, a new TCP proposal, the
    TCP Hybla, is presented and discussed in the paper[1]. It stems from an
    analytical evaluation of the congestion window dynamics in the TCP
    standard versions (Tahoe, Reno, NewReno), which suggests the necessary
    modifications to remove the performance dependence on RTT.[...]"[1]

    [PATCH] IDE CD reports current speed
    
    The current ide-cd driver reports the CDROM speed (as found in
    /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info) as the current speed when loading the driver.
    Changing the speed of the cdrom drive (by "eject -x" for instance) doesn't
    update the speed reported by the kernel.  Updating the info could be
    valuable for the user as it's the only way to know if the drive accepted
    the request or discarded it.  It could even be used to list all the
    available speeds of the drive.
    
    The attached patch modifies the ide-cd driver so that after every speed
    change request the new speed is updated.  Please note that the actual
    modification is very little but I had to touch quite a few lines in order

    [PATCH] aio: make wait_queue ->task ->private
    
    In the upcoming aio_down patch, it is useful to store a private data
    pointer in the kiocb's wait_queue.  Since we provide our own wake up
    function and do not require the task_struct pointer, it makes sense to
    convert the task pointer into a generic private pointer.

    [PATCH] Bug in error recovery in fs/buffer.c::__block_prepare_write()
    
    fs/buffer.c::__block_prepare_write() has broken error recovery.  It calls
    the get_block() callback with "create = 1" and if that succeeds it
    immediately clears buffer_new on the just allocated buffer (which has
    buffer_new set).
    
    The bug is that if an error occurs and get_block() returns != 0, we break
    from this loop and go into recovery code.  This code has this comment:
    
    /* Error case: */
    /*
     * Zero out any newly allocated blocks to avoid exposing stale
     * data.  If BH_New is set, we know that the block was newly
     * allocated in the above loop.
     */
    
    So the intent is obviously good in that it wants to clear just allocated
    and hence not zeroed buffers.  However the code recognises allocated
    buffers by checking for buffer_new being set.
    
    Unfortunately __block_prepare_write() as discussed above already cleared
    buffer_new on all allocated buffers thus no buffers will be cleared during
    error recovery and old data will be leaked.
    
    The simplest way I can see to fix this is to make the current recovery code
    work by _not_ clearing buffer_new after calling get_block() in
    __block_prepare_write().
    
    We cannot safely allow buffer_new buffers to "leak out" of
    __block_prepare_write(), thus we simply do a quick loop over the buffers
    clearing buffer_new on each of them if it is set just before returning
    "success" from __block_prepare_write().

    [PATCH] block: add unlocked_ioctl support for block devices
    
    This patch allows block device drivers to convert their ioctl functions to
    unlocked_ioctl() like character devices and other subsystems.  All
    functions that were called with the BKL held before are still used that
    way, but I would not be surprised if it could be removed from the ioctl
    functions in drivers/block/ioctl.c themselves.
    
    As a side note, I found that compat_blkdev_ioctl() acquires the BKL as
    well, which looks like a bug.  I have checked that every user of
    disk->fops->compat_ioctl() in the current git tree gets the BKL itself, so
    it could easily be removed from compat_blkdev_ioctl().

    [PATCH] yenta TI: turn off interrupts during card power-on #2
    
    - make boot-up card recognition more reliable (ie.  redo interrogation
      always if there is no valid 'card inserted' state) (and yes, i saw it
      happening on an o2micro controller that both CB_CBARD and CB_16BITCARD
      bits were set at the same time)
    
    - also redo interrogation before probing the ISA interrupts.  it's safer
      to do the probing with the socket in a clean state.
    
    - make card insert detect more reliable.  yenta_get_status() now returns
      SS_PENDING as long as the card is not completley inserted and one of the
      voltage bits is set.  also !CB_CBARD doesn't mean CB_16BITCARD.  there is
      CB_NOTACARD as well, so make an explicit check for CB_16BITCARD.
    
    - for TI bridges: disable IRQs during power-on.  in all-serial and tied
      interrupt mode the interrupts are always disabled for single-slot
      controllers.  for two-slot contollers the disabling is only done when the
      other slot is empty.  to force disabling there is a new module parameter
      now: pwr_irqs_off=Y (which is a regression for working setups.  that's
      why it's an option, only use when required)
    
    - modparm to disable ISA interrupt probing (isa_probe, defaults to on)
    
    - remove unneeded code/cleanups (ie.  merge yenta_events() into
      yenta_interrupts())

    [PATCH] Don't force O_LARGEFILE for 32 bit processes on ia64
    
    In ia64 kernel, the O_LARGEFILE flag is forced when opening a file.  This
    is problematic for execution of 32 bit processes, which are not largefile
    aware, either by SW emulation or by HW execution.
    
    For such processes, the problem is two-fold:
    
    1) When trying to open a file that is larger than 4G
       the operation should fail, but it's not
    2) Writing to offset larger than 4G should fail, but
       it's not
    
    The proposed patch takes advantage of the way 32 bit processes are
    identified in ia64 systems.  Such processes have PER_LINUX32 for their
    personality.  With the patch, the ia64 kernel will not enforce the
    O_LARGEFILE flag if the current process has PER_LINUX32 set.  The behavior
    for all other architectures remains unchanged.

    [PATCH] parport: NetMos nm9855 fix
    
    kernel 2.6.12-rc2 adopted some code by Bjorn Helgaas supporting NetMos combo
    controller cards. this implementation doesn't work for nm9855 based cards!
    
    there are two reasons:
    
    a) the module 'parport_pc' doesn't want to give the resonsibility for
       the netmos_9855 to 'parport_serial' and can not handle the serial lines
       -- trivial to fix...

       http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/24/199 b) the support for the nm9855 in

    [PATCH] Software suspend and recalc sigpending bug fix
    
    This patch fixes recalc_sigpending() to work correctly with tasks which are
    being freezed.
    
    The problem is that freeze_processes() sets PF_FREEZE and TIF_SIGPENDING
    flags on tasks, but recalc_sigpending() called from e.g.
    sys_rt_sigtimedwait or any other kernel place will clear TIF_SIGPENDING due
    to no pending signals queued and the tasks won't be freezed until it
    recieves a real signal or freezed_processes() fail due to timeout.

    [PATCH] Support for dx directories in ext3_get_parent (NFSD)
    
    Henrik Grubbstrom noted:
    
    The 2.6.10 ext3_get_parent attempts to use ext3_find_entry to look up the
    entry "..", which fails for dx directories since ".." is not present in the
    directory hash table.  The patch below solves this by looking up the dotdot
    entry in the dx_root block.
    
    Typical symptoms of the above bug are intermittent claims by nfsd that
    files or directories are missing on exported ext3 filesystems.
    
    cf https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D150759 and
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D144556
    
    ext3_get_parent() is IMHO the wrong place to fix this bug as it introduces
    a lot of internals from htree into that function.  Instead, I think this
    should be fixed in ext3_find_entry() as in the below patch.  This has the
    added advantage that it works for any callers of ext3_find_entry() and not
    just ext3_lookup_parent().

    [PATCH] setuid core dump
    
    Add a new `suid_dumpable' sysctl:
    
    This value can be used to query and set the core dump mode for setuid
    or otherwise protected/tainted binaries. The modes are
    
    0 - (default) - traditional behaviour.  Any process which has changed
        privilege levels or is execute only will not be dumped
    
    1 - (debug) - all processes dump core when possible.  The core dump is
        owned by the current user and no security is applied.  This is intended
        for system debugging situations only.  Ptrace is unchecked.
    
    2 - (suidsafe) - any binary which normally would not be dumped is dumped
        readable by root only.  This allows the end user to remove such a dump but
        not access it directly.  For security reasons core dumps in this mode will
        not overwrite one another or other files.  This mode is appropriate when
        adminstrators are attempting to debug problems in a normal environment.
    
    (akpm:
    
    > > +EXPORT_SYMBOL(suid_dumpable);
    >
    > EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL?
    
    No problem to me.
    
    > >  	if (current->euid == current->uid && current->egid == current->gid)
    > >  		current->mm->dumpable = 1;
    >
    > Should this be SUID_DUMP_USER?
    
    Actually the feedback I had from last time was that the SUID_ defines
    should go because its clearer to follow the numbers. They can go
    everywhere (and there are lots of places where dumpable is tested/used
    as a bool in untouched code)
    
    > Maybe this should be renamed to `dump_policy' or something.  Doing that
    > would help us catch any code which isn't using the #defines, too.
    
    Fair comment. The patch was designed to be easy to maintain for Red Hat
    rather than for merging. Changing that field would create a gigantic
    diff because it is used all over the place.

    [PATCH] kprobes: Temporary disarming of reentrant probe
    
    In situations where a kprobes handler calls a routine which has a probe on it,
    then kprobes_handler() disarms the new probe forever.  This patch removes the
    above limitation by temporarily disarming the new probe.  When the another
    probe hits while handling the old probe, the kprobes_handler() saves previous
    kprobes state and handles the new probe without calling the new kprobes
    registered handlers.  kprobe_post_handler() restores back the previous kprobes
    state and the normal execution continues.
    
    However on x86_64 architecture, re-rentrancy is provided only through
    pre_handler().  If a routine having probe is referenced through
    post_handler(), then the probes on that routine are disarmed forever, since
    the exception stack is gets changed after the processor single steps the
    instruction of the new probe.
    
    This patch includes generic changes to support temporary disarming on
    reentrancy of probes.

    [PATCH] Kprobes IA64: cmp ctype unc support
    
    The current Kprobes when patching the original instruction with the break
    instruction tries to retain the original qualifying predicate(qp), however
    for cmp.crel.ctype where ctype == unc, which is a special instruction
    always needs to be executed irrespective of qp.  Hence, if the instruction
    we are patching is of this type, then we should not copy the original qp to
    the break instruction, this is because we always want the break fault to
    happen so that we can emulate the instruction.
    
    This patch is based on the feedback given by David Mosberger

    [PATCH] Kprobes ia64 cleanup
    
    A cleanup of the ia64 kprobes implementation such that all of the bundle
    manipulation logic is concentrated in arch_prepare_kprobe().
    
    With the current design for kprobes, the arch specific code only has a
    chance to return failure inside the arch_prepare_kprobe() function.
    
    This patch moves all of the work that was happening in arch_copy_kprobe()
    and most of the work that was happening in arch_arm_kprobe() into
    arch_prepare_kprobe().  By doing this we can add further robustness checks
    in arch_arm_kprobe() and refuse to insert kprobes that will cause problems.

    [PATCH] Kprobes/IA64: kdebug die notification mechanism
    
    As many of you know that kprobes exist in the main line kernel for various
    architecture including i386, x86_64, ppc64 and sparc64.  Attached patches
    following this mail are a port of Kprobes and Jprobes for IA64.
    
    I have tesed this patches for kprobes and Jprobes and this seems to work fine.
     I have tested this patch by inserting kprobes on various slots and various
    templates including various types of branch instructions.
    
    I have also tested this patch using the tool
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111657358022586&w=2 and the
    kprobes for IA64 works great.
    
    Here is list of TODO things and pathes for the same will appear soon.
    
    1) Support kprobes on "mov r1=ip" type of instruction
    2) Support Kprobes and Jprobes to exist on the same address
    3) Support Return probes
    3) Architecture independent cleanup of kprobes
    
    This patch adds the kdebug die notification mechanism needed by Kprobes.
    
    For break instruction on Branch type slot, imm21 is ignored and value
    zero is placed in IIM register, hence we need to handle kprobes
    for switch case zero.

    From: Rusty Lynch <rusty.lynch@intel.com>
    
    At the point in traps.c where we recieve a break with a zero value, we can
    not say if the break was a result of a kprobe or some other debug facility.
    
    This simple patch changes the informational string to a more correct "break
    0" value, and applies to the 2.6.12-rc2-mm2 tree with all the kprobes
    patches that were just recently included for the next mm cut.

    [PATCH] Move kprobe [dis]arming into arch specific code
    
    The architecture independent code of the current kprobes implementation is
    arming and disarming kprobes at registration time.  The problem is that the
    code is assuming that arming and disarming is a just done by a simple write
    of some magic value to an address.  This is problematic for ia64 where our
    instructions look more like structures, and we can not insert break points
    by just doing something like:
    
    *p->addr = BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION;
    
    The following patch to 2.6.12-rc4-mm2 adds two new architecture dependent
    functions:
    
         * void arch_arm_kprobe(struct kprobe *p)
         * void arch_disarm_kprobe(struct kprobe *p)
    
    and then adds the new functions for each of the architectures that already
    implement kprobes (spar64/ppc64/i386/x86_64).
    
    I thought arch_[dis]arm_kprobe was the most descriptive of what was really
    happening, but each of the architectures already had a disarm_kprobe()
    function that was really a "disarm and do some other clean-up items as
    needed when you stumble across a recursive kprobe." So...  I took the
    liberty of changing the code that was calling disarm_kprobe() to call
    arch_disarm_kprobe(), and then do the cleanup in the block of code dealing
    with the recursive kprobe case.
    
    So far this patch as been tested on i386, x86_64, and ppc64, but still
    needs to be tested in sparc64.

    [PATCH] x86_64 specific function return probes
    
    The following patch adds the x86_64 architecture specific implementation
    for function return probes.
    
    Function return probes is a mechanism built on top of kprobes that allows
    a caller to register a handler to be called when a given function exits.
    For example, to instrument the return path of sys_mkdir:
    
    static int sys_mkdir_exit(struct kretprobe_instance *i, struct pt_regs *regs)
    {
    	printk("sys_mkdir exited\n");
    	return 0;
    }
    static struct kretprobe return_probe = {
    	.handler = sys_mkdir_exit,
    };
    
    <inside setup function>
    
    return_probe.kp.addr = (kprobe_opcode_t *) kallsyms_lookup_name("sys_mkdir");
    if (register_kretprobe(&return_probe)) {
    	printk(KERN_DEBUG "Unable to register return probe!\n");
    	/* do error path */
    }
    
    <inside cleanup function>
    unregister_kretprobe(&return_probe);
    
    The way this works is that:
    
    * At system initialization time, kernel/kprobes.c installs a kprobe
      on a function called kretprobe_trampoline() that is implemented in
      the arch/x86_64/kernel/kprobes.c  (More on this later)
    
    * When a return probe is registered using register_kretprobe(),
      kernel/kprobes.c will install a kprobe on the first instruction of the
      targeted function with the pre handler set to arch_prepare_kretprobe()
      which is implemented in arch/x86_64/kernel/kprobes.c.
    
    * arch_prepare_kretprobe() will prepare a kretprobe instance that stores:
      - nodes for hanging this instance in an empty or free list
      - a pointer to the return probe
      - the original return address
      - a pointer to the stack address
    
      With all this stowed away, arch_prepare_kretprobe() then sets the return
      address for the targeted function to a special trampoline function called
      kretprobe_trampoline() implemented in arch/x86_64/kernel/kprobes.c
    
    * The kprobe completes as normal, with control passing back to the target
      function that executes as normal, and eventually returns to our trampoline
      function.
    
    * Since a kprobe was installed on kretprobe_trampoline() during system
      initialization, control passes back to kprobes via the architecture
      specific function trampoline_probe_handler() which will lookup the
      instance in an hlist maintained by kernel/kprobes.c, and then call
      the handler function.
    
    * When trampoline_probe_handler() is done, the kprobes infrastructure
      single steps the original instruction (in this case just a top), and
      then calls trampoline_post_handler().  trampoline_post_handler() then
      looks up the instance again, puts the instance back on the free list,
      and then makes a long jump back to the original return instruction.
    
    So to recap, to instrument the exit path of a function this implementation
    will cause four interruptions:
    
      - A breakpoint at the very beginning of the function allowing us to
        switch out the return address
      - A single step interruption to execute the original instruction that
        we replaced with the break instruction (normal kprobe flow)
      - A breakpoint in the trampoline function where our instrumented function
        returned to
      - A single step interruption to execute the original instruction that
        we replaced with the break instruction (normal kprobe flow)

    [PATCH] kprobes: function-return probes
    
    This patch adds function-return probes to kprobes for the i386
    architecture.  This enables you to establish a handler to be run when a
    function returns.
    
    1. API
    
    Two new functions are added to kprobes:
    
    	int register_kretprobe(struct kretprobe *rp);
    	void unregister_kretprobe(struct kretprobe *rp);
    
    2. Registration and unregistration
    
    2.1 Register
    
      To register a function-return probe, the user populates the following
      fields in a kretprobe object and calls register_kretprobe() with the
      kretprobe address as an argument:
    
      kp.addr - the function's address
    
      handler - this function is run after the ret instruction executes, but
      before control returns to the return address in the caller.
    
      maxactive - The maximum number of instances of the probed function that
      can be active concurrently.  For example, if the function is non-
      recursive and is called with a spinlock or mutex held, maxactive = 1
      should be enough.  If the function is non-recursive and can never
      relinquish the CPU (e.g., via a semaphore or preemption), NR_CPUS should
      be enough.  maxactive is used to determine how many kretprobe_instance
      objects to allocate for this particular probed function.  If maxactive <=
      0, it is set to a default value (if CONFIG_PREEMPT maxactive=max(10, 2 *
      NR_CPUS) else maxactive=NR_CPUS)
    
      For example:
    
        struct kretprobe rp;
        rp.kp.addr = /* entrypoint address */
        rp.handler = /*return probe handler */
        rp.maxactive = /* e.g., 1 or NR_CPUS or 0, see the above explanation */
        register_kretprobe(&rp);
    
      The following field may also be of interest:
    
      nmissed - Initialized to zero when the function-return probe is
      registered, and incremented every time the probed function is entered but
      there is no kretprobe_instance object available for establishing the
      function-return probe (i.e., because maxactive was set too low).
    
    2.2 Unregister
    
      To unregiter a function-return probe, the user calls
      unregister_kretprobe() with the same kretprobe object as registered
      previously.  If a probed function is running when the return probe is
      unregistered, the function will return as expected, but the handler won't
      be run.
    
    3. Limitations
    
    3.1 This patch supports only the i386 architecture, but patches for
        x86_64 and ppc64 are anticipated soon.
    
    3.2 Return probes operates by replacing the return address in the stack
        (or in a known register, such as the lr register for ppc).  This may
        cause __builtin_return_address(0), when invoked from the return-probed
        function, to return the address of the return-probes trampoline.
    
    3.3 This implementation uses the "Multiprobes at an address" feature in
        2.6.12-rc3-mm3.
    
    3.4 Due to a limitation in multi-probes, you cannot currently establish
        a return probe and a jprobe on the same function.  A patch to remove
        this limitation is being tested.
    
    This feature is required by SystemTap (http://sourceware.org/systemtap),
    and reflects ideas contributed by several SystemTap developers, including
    Will Cohen and Ananth Mavinakayanahalli.

    [PATCH] preempt_count is int - remove cast and don't assign to unsigned type
    
    In kernel/sched.c the return value from preempt_count() is cast to an int.
    That made sense when preempt_count was defined as different types on is not
    needed and should go away.  The patch removes the cast.
    
    In kernel/timer.c the return value from preempt_count() is assigned to a
    variable of type u32 and then that unsigned value is later compared to
    preempt_count().  Since preempt_count() returns an int, an int is what
    should be used to store its return value.  Storing the result in an
    unsigned 32bit integer made a tiny bit of sense back when preempt_count was
    different types on different archs, but no more - let's not play signed vs
    unsigned comparison games when we don't have to.  The patch modifies the
    code to use an int to hold the value.  While I was around that bit of code
    I also made two changes to a nearby (related) printk() - I modified it to
    specify the loglevel explicitly and also broke the line into a few pieces
    to avoid it being longer than 80 chars and clarified the text a bit.

    [PATCH] streamline preempt_count type across archs
    
    The preempt_count member of struct thread_info is currently either defined
    as int, unsigned int or __s32 depending on arch.  This patch makes the type
    of preempt_count an int on all archs.
    
    Having preempt_count be an unsigned type prevents the catching of
    preempt_count < 0 bugs, and using int on some archs and __s32 on others is
    not exactely "neat" - much nicer when it's just int all over.
    
    A previous version of this patch was already ACK'ed by Robert Love, and the
    only change in this version of the patch compared to the one he ACK'ed is
    that this one also makes sure the preempt_count member is consistently
    commented.

    [PATCH] optimise loop driver a bit
    
    Looks like locking can be optimised quite a lot.  Increase lock widths
    slightly so lo_lock is taken fewer times per request.  Also it was quite
    trivial to cover lo_pending with that lock, and remove the atomic
    requirement.  This also makes memory ordering explicitly correct, which is
    nice (not that I particularly saw any mem ordering bugs).

    block size, 4K page size).  System is 2 socket Xeon with HT (4 thread).

    This does not currently happen if there is more than one console specified
    on the boot commandline.  Instead, it gets set on the first console on the
    command line.  This can cause problems for things like kdb that look for
    the CON_CONSDEV flag to see if the console is valid.
    
    Additionaly, it doesn't look like CON_CONSDEV is reassigned to the next
    preferred console at unregister time if the console being unregistered
    currently has that bit set.
    
    Example (from sn2 ia64):
    
    elilo vmlinuz root=<dev> console=ttyS0 console=ttySG0
    
    in this case, the flags on ttySG console struct will be 0x4 (should be
    0x6).
    
    Attached patch against bk fixes both issues for the cases I looked at.  It
    uses selected_console (which gets incremented for each console specified on
    the command line) as the indicator of which console to set CON_CONSDEV on.
    When adding the console to the list, if the previous one had CON_CONSDEV
    set, it masks it out.  Tested on ia64 and x86.
    
    The problem with the current behavior is it breaks overriding the default from
    the boot line.  In the ia64 case, there may be a global append line defining
    console=a in elilo.conf.  Then you want to boot your kernel, and want to
    override the default by passing console=b on the boot line.  elilo constructs
    the kernel cmdline by starting with the value of the global append line, then
    tacks on whatever else you specify, which puts console=b last.

    [PATCH] create a kstrdup library function
    
    This patch creates a new kstrdup library function and changes the "local"
    implementations in several places to use this function.
    
    Most of the changes come from the sound and net subsystems.  The sound part
    had already been acknowledged by Takashi Iwai and the net part by David S.
    Miller.

    [PATCH] fix for prune_icache()/forced final iput() races
    
    Based on analysis and a patch from Russ Weight <rweight@us.ibm.com>
    
    There is a race condition that can occur if an inode is allocated and then
    released (using iput) during the ->fill_super functions.  The race
    condition is between kswapd and mount.
    
    For most filesystems this can only happen in an error path when kswapd is
    running concurrently.  For isofs, however, the error can occur in a more
    common code path (which is how the bug was found).
    
    The logic here is "we want final iput() to free inode *now* instead of
    letting it sit in cache if fs is going down or had not quite come up".  The
    problem is with kswapd seeing such inodes in the middle of being killed and
    happily taking over.
    
    The clean solution would be to tell kswapd to leave those inodes alone and
    let our final iput deal with them.  I.e.  add a new flag
    (I_FORCED_FREEING), set it before write_inode_now() there and make
    prune_icache() leave those alone.

    [PATCH] timers: introduce try_to_del_timer_sync()
    
    This patch splits del_timer_sync() into 2 functions.  The new one,
    try_to_del_timer_sync(), returns -1 when it hits executing timer.
    
    It can be used in interrupt context, or when the caller hold locks which
    can prevent completion of the timer's handler.
    
    NOTE.  Currently it can't be used in interrupt context in UP case, because
    ->running_timer is used only with CONFIG_SMP.
    
    Should the need arise, it is possible to kill #ifdef CONFIG_SMP in
    set_running_timer(), it is cheap.

    [PATCH] timers fixes/improvements
    
    This patch tries to solve following problems:
    
    1. del_timer_sync() is racy. The timer can be fired again after
       del_timer_sync have checked all cpus and before it will recheck
       timer_pending().
    
    2. It has scalability problems. All cpus are scanned to determine
       if the timer is running on that cpu.
    
       With this patch del_timer_sync is O(1) and no slower than plain
       del_timer(pending_timer), unless it has to actually wait for
       completion of the currently running timer.
    
       The only restriction is that the recurring timer should not use
       add_timer_on().
    
    3. The timers are not serialized wrt to itself.
    
       If CPU_0 does mod_timer(jiffies+1) while the timer is currently
       running on CPU 1, it is quite possible that local interrupt on
       CPU_0 will start that timer before it finished on CPU_1.
    
    4. The timers locking is suboptimal. __mod_timer() takes 3 locks
       at once and still requires wmb() in del_timer/run_timers.
    
       The new implementation takes 2 locks sequentially and does not
       need memory barriers.
    
    Currently ->base != NULL means that the timer is pending. In that case
    ->base.lock is used to lock the timer. __mod_timer also takes timer->lock
    because ->base can be == NULL.
    
    This patch uses timer->entry.next != NULL as indication that the timer is
    pending. So it does __list_del(), entry->next = NULL instead of list_del()
    when the timer is deleted.
    
    The ->base field is used for hashed locking only, it is initialized
    in init_timer() which sets ->base = per_cpu(tvec_bases). When the
    tvec_bases.lock is locked, it means that all timers which are tied
    to this base via timer->base are locked, and the base itself is locked
    too.
    
    So __run_timers/migrate_timers can safely modify all timers which could
    be found on ->tvX lists (pending timers).
    
    When the timer's base is locked, and the timer removed from ->entry list
    (which means that _run_timers/migrate_timers can't see this timer), it is
    possible to set timer->base = NULL and drop the lock: the timer remains
    locked.
    
    This patch adds lock_timer_base() helper, which waits for ->base != NULL,
    locks the ->base, and checks it is still the same.
    
    __mod_timer() schedules the timer on the local CPU and changes it's base.
    However, it does not lock both old and new bases at once. It locks the
    timer via lock_timer_base(), deletes the timer, sets ->base = NULL, and
    unlocks old base. Then __mod_timer() locks new_base, sets ->base = new_base,
    and adds this timer. This simplifies the code, because AB-BA deadlock is not
    possible. __mod_timer() also ensures that the timer's base is not changed
    while the timer's handler is running on the old base.
    
    __run_timers(), del_timer() do not change ->base anymore, they only clear
    pending flag.
    
    So del_timer_sync() can test timer->base->running_timer == timer to detect
    whether it is running or not.
    
    We don't need timer_list->lock anymore, this patch kills it.
    
    We also don't need barriers. del_timer() and __run_timers() used smp_wmb()
    before clearing timer's pending flag. It was needed because __mod_timer()
    did not lock old_base if the timer is not pending, so __mod_timer()->list_add()
    could race with del_timer()->list_del(). With this patch these functions are
    serialized through base->lock.
    
    One problem. TIMER_INITIALIZER can't use per_cpu(tvec_bases). So this patch
    adds global
    
            struct timer_base_s {
                    spinlock_t lock;
                    struct timer_list *running_timer;
            } __init_timer_base;
    
    which is used by TIMER_INITIALIZER. The corresponding fields in tvec_t_base_s
    struct are replaced by struct timer_base_s t_base.
    
    It is indeed ugly. But this can't have scalability problems. The global
    __init_timer_base.lock is used only when __mod_timer() is called for the first
    time AND the timer was compile time initialized. After that the timer migrates
    to the local CPU.

    [PATCH] blk: no memory barrier
    
    This memory barrier is not needed because the waitqueue will only get waiters
    on it in the following situations:
    
    rq->count has exceeded the threshold - however all manipulations of ->count
    are performed under the runqueue lock, and so we will correctly pick up any
    waiter.
    
    Memory allocation for the request fails.  In this case, there is no additional
    help provided by the memory barrier.  We are guaranteed to eventually wake up
    waiters because the request allocation mempool guarantees that if the mem
    allocation for a request fails, there must be some requests in flight.  They
    will wake up waiters when they are retired.

    blk_queue_tag->real_max_depth was used to optimize out unnecessary
    allocations/frees on tag resize.  However, the whole thing was very broken -
    tag_map was never allocated to real_max_depth resulting in access beyond the
    end of the map, bits in [max_depth..real_max_depth] were set when initializing
    a map and copied when resizing resulting in pre-occupied tags.
    
    As the gain of the optimization is very small, well, almost nill, remove the
    whole thing.

    [PATCH] x86_64: avoid wasting IRQs
    
    I suggest to change the way IRQs are handed out to PCI devices.
    
    Currently, each I/O APIC pin gets associated with an IRQ, no matter if the
    pin is used or not.  It is expected that each pin can potentually be
    engaged by a device inserted into the corresponding PCI slot.  However,
    this imposes severe limitation on systems that have designs that employ
    many I/O APICs, only utilizing couple lines of each, such as P64H2 chipset.
    
    It is used in ES7000, and currently, there is no way to boot the system
    with more that 9 I/O APICs.
    
    The simple change below allows to boot a system with say 64 (or more) I/O
    APICs, each providing 1 slot, which otherwise impossible because of the IRQ
    gaps created for unused lines on each I/O APIC.  It does not resolve the
    problem with number of devices that exceeds number of possible IRQs, but
    eases up a tension for IRQs on any large system with potentually large
    number of devices.
    
    I only implemented this for the ACPI boot, since if the system is this big
    and using newer chipsets it is probably (better be!) an ACPI based system
    :).  The change is completely "mechanical" and does not alter any internal
    structures or interrupt model/implementation.  The patch works for both
    i386 and x86_64 archs.  It works with MSIs just fine, and should not
    intervene with implementations like shared vectors, when they get worked
    out and incorporated.
    
    To illustrate, below is the interrupt distribution for 2-cell ES7000 with
    20 I/O APICs, and an Ethernet card in the last slot, which should be eth1
    and which was not configured because its IRQ exceeded allowable number (it
    actially turned out huge - 480!):

    [PATCH] x86_64: never block forced SIGSEGV
    
    This is the x86_64 version of the signal fix I just posted for i386.
    
    This problem was first noticed on PPC and has already been fixed there.
    But the exact same issue applies to other platforms in the same way.  The
    signal blocking for sa_mask and the handled signal takes place after the
    handler setup.  When the stack is bogus, the handler setup forces a
    SIGSEGV.  But then this will be blocked, and returning to user mode will
    fault again and iterate.  This patch fixes the problem by checking whether
    signal handler setup failed, and not doing the signal-blocking if so.  This
    copies what was done in the ppc code.  I think all architectures' signal
    handler setup code follows this pattern and needs the change.

    [PATCH] x86_64: fix hpet for systems that don't support legacy replacement
    
    Currently the x86-64 HPET code assumes the entire HPET implementation from
    the spec is present.  This breaks on boxes that do not implement the
    optional legacy timer replacement functionality portion of the spec.
    
    This patch fixes this issue, allowing x86-64 systems that cannot use the
    HPET for the timer interrupt and RTC to still use the HPET as a time
    source.  I've tested this patch on a system systems without HPET, with HPET
    but without legacy timer replacement, as well as HPET with legacy timer
    replacement.
    
    This version adds a minor check to cap the HPET counter value in
    gettimeoffset_hpet to avoid possible time inconsistencies.  Please ignore
    the A2 version I sent to you earlier.

    [PATCH] x86: avoid wasting IRQs for PCI devices
    
    I have submitted the patch for x86_64, this is submission for i386.
    
    The patch changes the way IRQs are handed out to PCI devices.  Currently,
    each I/O APIC pin gets associated with an IRQ, no matter if the pin is used
    or not.  This imposes severe limitation on systems that have designs that
    employ many I/O APICs, only utilizing couple lines of each, such as P64H2
    chipset.  It is used in ES7000, and currently, there is no way to boot the
    system with more that 9 I/O APICs.
    
    The simple change below allows to boot a system with say 64 (or more) I/O
    APICs, each providing 1 slot, which otherwise impossible because of the IRQ
    gaps created for unused lines on each I/O APIC.  It does not resolve the
    problem with number of devices that exceeds number of possible IRQs, but
    eases up a tension for IRQs on any large system with potentually large
    number of devices.

    This patch is per Andi's request to remove NO_IOAPIC_CHECK from genapic and

    other platforms that don't use serial APIC bus for interrupt delivery.
    Andi stated that AMD systems don't need unique IO_APIC_IDs either.

    [PATCH] i386: never block forced SIGSEGV
    
    This problem was first noticed on PPC and has already been fixed there.
    But the exact same issue applies to other platforms in the same way.  The
    signal blocking for sa_mask and the handled signal takes place after the
    handler setup.  When the stack is bogus, the handler setup forces a
    SIGSEGV.  But then this will be blocked, and returning to user mode will
    fault again and iterate.  This patch fixes the problem by checking whether
    signal handler setup failed, and not doing the signal-blocking if so.  This
    copies what was done in the ppc code.  I think all architectures' signal
    handler setup code follows this pattern and needs the change.

    [PATCH] x86/x86_64: pcibus_to_node
    
    Define pcibus_to_node to be able to figure out which NUMA node contains a
    given PCI device.  This defines pcibus_to_node(bus) in
    include/linux/topology.h and adjusts the macros for i386 and x86_64 that
    already provided a way to determine the cpumask of a pci device.
    
    x86_64 was changed to not build an array of cpumasks anymore.  Instead an
    array of nodes is build which can be used to generate the cpumask via
    node_to_cpumask.

    [PATCH] Platform SMIs and their interferance with tsc based delay calibration
    
    Issue:
    Current tsc based delay_calibration can result in significant errors in
    loops_per_jiffy count when the platform events like SMIs
    (System Management Interrupts that are non-maskable) are present. This could
    lead to potential kernel panic(). This issue is becoming more visible with 2.6
    kernel (as default HZ is 1000) and on platforms with higher SMI handling
    latencies. During the boot time, SMIs are mostly used by BIOS (for things
    like legacy keyboard emulation).
    
    Description:
    The psuedocode for current delay calibration with tsc based delay looks like
    (0) Estimate a value for loops_per_jiffy
    (1) While (loops_per_jiffy estimate is accurate enough)
    (2)   wait for jiffy transition (jiffy1)
    (3)   Note down current tsc (tsc1)
    (4)   loop until tsc becomes tsc1 + loops_per_jiffy
    (5)   check whether jiffy changed since jiffy1 or not and refine
    loops_per_jiffy estimate
    
    Consider the following cases
    Case 1:
    If SMIs happen between (2) and (3) above, we can end up with a
    loops_per_jiffy value that is too low. This results in shorted delays and
    kernel can panic () during boot (Mostly at IOAPIC timer initialization
    timer_irq_works() as we don't have enough timer interrupts in a specified
    interval).
    
    Case 2:
    If SMIs happen between (3) and (4) above, then we can end up with a
    loops_per_jiffy value that is too high. And with current i386 code, too
    high lpj value (greater than 17M) can result in a overflow in
    delay.c:__const_udelay() again resulting in shorter delay and panic().
    
    Solution:
    The patch below makes the calibration routine aware of asynchronous events
    like SMIs. We increase the delay calibration time and also identify any
    significant errors (greater than 12.5%) in the calibration and notify it to
    user.
    
    Patch below changes both i386 and x86-64 architectures to use this
    new and improved calibrate_delay_direct() routine.

    [PATCH] use ${CROSS_COMPILE}installkernel in arch/*/boot/install.sh
    
    The attached patch causes the various arch specific install.sh scripts to
    look for ${CROSS_COMPILE}installkernel rather than just installkernel (in
    both /sbin/ and ~/bin/ where the script already did this).  This allows you
    to have e.g.  arm-linux-installkernel as a handy way to install on your
    cross target.  It also prevents the script picking up on the host
    /sbin/installkernel which causes the script to fall through and do the
    install itself (which is what I actually use myself, with $INSTALL_PATH
    set).
    
    I don't believe it causes back-compatibility problems since calling the
    host installkernel was never likely to work or be what you wanted when
    cross compiling anyway.  If $CROSS_COMPILE isn't set then nothing changes.
    
    I only use ARM and i386 myself but I figured it couldn't hurt to do the
    whole lot.  I've cc'd those who I hope are the arch maintainers for files
    that I've touched.

    This patch adds in the necessary support for sparsemem such that x86-64
    kernels may use sparsemem as an alternative to discontigmem for NUMA

    kernels with sparsemem.
    
    Interestingly, the use of sparsemem in lieu of discontigmem in NUMA kernels
    results in reduced text size for otherwise equivalent kernels as shown in
    the example builds below:

    [PATCH] sparsemem hotplug base
    
    Make sparse's initalization be accessible at runtime.  This allows sparse
    mappings to be created after boot in a hotplug situation.
    
    This patch is separated from the previous one just to give an indication how
    much of the sparse infrastructure is *just* for hotplug memory.
    
    The section_mem_map doesn't really store a pointer.  It stores something that
    is convenient to do some math against to get a pointer.  It isn't valid to
    just do *section_mem_map, so I don't think it should be stored as a pointer.
    
    There are a couple of things I'd like to store about a section.  First of all,
    the fact that it is !NULL does not mean that it is present.  There could be
    such a combination where section_mem_map *is* NULL, but the math gets you
    properly to a real mem_map.  So, I don't think that check is safe.
    
    Since we're storing 32-bit-aligned structures, we have a few bits in the
    bottom of the pointer to play with.  Use one bit to encode whether there's
    really a mem_map there, and the other one to tell whether there's a valid
    section there.  We need to distinguish between the two because sometimes
    there's a gap between when a section is discovered to be present and when we
    can get the mem_map for it.

    [PATCH] sparsemem swiss cheese numa layouts
    
    The part of the sparsemem patch which modifies memmap_init_zone() has recently
    become a problem.  It changes behavior so that there is a call to
    pfn_to_page() for each individual page inside of a node's range:
    node_start_pfn through node_end_pfn.  It used to simply do this once, at the
    beginning of the node, but having sparsemem's non-contiguous mem_map[]s inside
    of a node made it necessary to change.
    
    Mike Kravetz recently wrote a patch which made the NUMA code accept some new
    kinds of layouts.  The system's memory was laid out like this, with node 0's
    memory in two pieces: one before and one after node 1's memory:
    
    	Node 0: +++++     +++++
    	Node 1:      +++++
    
    Previous behavior before Mike's patch was to assign nodes like this:
    
    	Node 0: 00000     XXXXX
    	Node 1:      11111
    
    Where the 'X' areas were simply thrown away.  The new behavior was to make the
    pg_data_t span node 0 across all of its areas, including areas that are really
    node 1's: Node 0: 000000000000000 Node 1: 11111
    
    This wastes a little bit of mem_map space, but ends up being OK, and more
    fully utilizes the system's memory.  memmap_init_zone() initializes all of the
    "struct page"s for node 0, even for the "hole", but those never get used,
    because there is no pfn_to_page() that resolves to those pages.  However, only
    calling pfn_to_page() once, memmap_init_zone() always uses the pages that were
    allocated for node0->node_mem_map because:
    
    	struct page *start = pfn_to_page(start_pfn);
    	// effectively start = &node->node_mem_map[0]
    	for (page = start; page < (start + size); page++) {
    		init_page_here();...
    		page++;
    	}
    
    Slow, and wasteful, but generally harmless.
    
    But, modify that to call pfn_to_page() for each loop iteration (like sparsemem
    does):
    
    	for (pfn = start_pfn; pfn < < (start_pfn + size); pfn++++) {
    		page = pfn_to_page(pfn);
    	}
    
    And you end up trying to initialize node 1's pages too early, along with bogus
    data from node 0.  This patch checks for those weird layouts and declines to
    touch the pages, making the more frequent pfn_to_page() calls OK to do.

    [PATCH] sparsemem memory model
    
    Sparsemem abstracts the use of discontiguous mem_maps[].  This kind of
    mem_map[] is needed by discontiguous memory machines (like in the old
    CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM case) as well as memory hotplug systems.  Sparsemem
    replaces DISCONTIGMEM when enabled, and it is hoped that it can eventually
    become a complete replacement.
    
    A significant advantage over DISCONTIGMEM is that it's completely separated
    from CONFIG_NUMA.  When producing this patch, it became apparent in that NUMA
    and DISCONTIG are often confused.
    
    Another advantage is that sparse doesn't require each NUMA node's ranges to be
    contiguous.  It can handle overlapping ranges between nodes with no problems,
    where DISCONTIGMEM currently throws away that memory.
    
    Sparsemem uses an array to provide different pfn_to_page() translations for
    each SECTION_SIZE area of physical memory.  This is what allows the mem_map[]
    to be chopped up.
    
    In order to do quick pfn_to_page() operations, the section number of the page
    is encoded in page->flags.  Part of the sparsemem infrastructure enables
    sharing of these bits more dynamically (at compile-time) between the
    page_zone() and sparsemem operations.  However, on 32-bit architectures, the
    number of bits is quite limited, and may require growing the size of the
    page->flags type in certain conditions.  Several things might force this to
    occur: a decrease in the SECTION_SIZE (if you want to hotplug smaller areas of
    memory), an increase in the physical address space, or an increase in the
    number of used page->flags.
    
    One thing to note is that, once sparsemem is present, the NUMA node
    information no longer needs to be stored in the page->flags.  It might provide
    speed increases on certain platforms and will be stored there if there is
    room.  But, if out of room, an alternate (theoretically slower) mechanism is
    used.
    
    This patch introduces CONFIG_FLATMEM.  It is used in almost all cases where
    there used to be an #ifndef DISCONTIG, because SPARSEMEM and DISCONTIGMEM
    often have to compile out the same areas of code.

    [PATCH] Introduce new Kconfig option for NUMA or DISCONTIG
    
    There is some confusion that arose when working on SPARSEMEM patch between
    what is needed for DISCONTIG vs. NUMA.
    
    Multiple pg_data_t's are needed for DISCONTIGMEM or NUMA, independently.
    All of the current NUMA implementations require an implementation of
    DISCONTIG.  Because of this, quite a lot of code which is really needed for
    NUMA is actually under DISCONTIG #ifdefs.  For SPARSEMEM, we changed some
    of these #ifdefs to CONFIG_NUMA, but that broke the DISCONTIG=y and NUMA=n
    case.
    
    Introducing this new NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES config option allows code that is
    needed for both NUMA or DISCONTIG to be separated out from code that is
    specific to DISCONTIG.
    
    One great advantage of this approach is that it doesn't require every
    architecture to be converted over.  All of the current implementations
    should "just work", only the ones implementing SPARSEMEM will have to be
    fixed up.
    
    The change to free_area_init() makes it work inside, or out of the new
    config option.

    [PATCH] create mm/Kconfig for arch-independent memory options
    
    With sparsemem being introduced, we need a central place for new
    memory-related .config options: mm/Kconfig.  This allows us to remove many
    of the duplicated arch-specific options.
    
    The new option, CONFIG_FLATMEM, is there to enable us to detangle NUMA and
    DISCONTIGMEM.  This is a requirement for sparsemem because sparsemem uses
    the NUMA code without the presence of DISCONTIGMEM.  The sparsemem patches
    use CONFIG_FLATMEM in generic code, so this patch is a requirement before
    applying them.
    
    Almost all places that used to do '#ifndef CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM' should use
    '#ifdef CONFIG_FLATMEM' instead.

    [PATCH] sparsemem base: simple NUMA remap space allocator
    
    Introduce a simple allocator for the NUMA remap space.  This space is very
    scarce, used for structures which are best allocated node local.
    
    This mechanism is also used on non-NUMA ia64 systems with a vmem_map to keep
    the pgdat->node_mem_map initialized in a consistent place for all
    architectures.
    
    Issues:
    o alloc_remap takes a node_id where we might expect a pgdat which was intended
      to allow us to allocate the pgdat's using this mechanism; which we do not yet
      do.  Could have alloc_remap_node() and alloc_remap_nid() for this purpose.

    [PATCH] sparsemem base: early_pfn_to_nid() (works before sparse is initialized)
    
    The following four patches provide the last needed changes before the
    introduction of sparsemem.  For a more complete description of what this
    will do, please see this patch:
    
    http://www.sr71.net/patches/2.6.11/2.6.11-bk7-mhp1/broken-out/B-sparse-150-sparsemem.patch

    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm&m=109897373315016&w=2
    
    Three of these are i386-only, but one of them reorganizes the macros
    used to manage the space in page->flags, and will affect all platforms.
    There are analogous patches to the i386 ones for ppc64, ia64, and
    x86_64, but those will be submitted by the normal arch maintainers.
    
    The combination of the four patches has been test-booted on a variety of
    i386 hardware, and compiled for ppc64, i386, and x86-64 with about 17
    different .configs.  It's also been runtime-tested on ia64 configs (with
    more patches on top).
    
    This patch:
    
    We _know_ which node pages in general belong to, at least at a very gross
    level in node_{start,end}_pfn[].  Use those to target the allocations of
    pages.

    [PATCH] remove non-DISCONTIG use of pgdat->node_mem_map
    
    This patch effectively eliminates direct use of pgdat->node_mem_map outside
    of the DISCONTIG code.  On a flat memory system, these fields aren't
    currently used, neither are they on a sparsemem system.
    
    There was also a node_mem_map(nid) macro on many architectures.  Its use
    along with the use of ->node_mem_map itself was not consistent.  It has
    been removed in favor of two new, more explicit, arch-independent macros:
    
    	pgdat_page_nr(pgdat, pagenr)
    	nid_page_nr(nid, pagenr)
    
    I called them "pgdat" and "nid" because we overload the term "node" to mean
    "NUMA node", "DISCONTIG node" or "pg_data_t" in very confusing ways.  I
    believe the newer names are much clearer.
    
    These macros can be overridden in the sparsemem case with a theoretically
    slower operation using node_start_pfn and pfn_to_page(), instead.  We could
    make this the only behavior if people want, but I don't want to change too
    much at once.  One thing at a time.
    
    This patch removes more code than it adds.
    
    Compile tested on alpha, alpha discontig, arm, arm-discontig, i386, i386
    generic, NUMAQ, Summit, ppc64, ppc64 discontig, and x86_64.  Full list

    drm: 32/64-bit DRM ioctl compatibility patch
    
    The patch is against a 2.6.11 kernel tree.  I am running this with a
    32-bit X server (compiled up from X.org CVS as of a couple of weeks
    ago) and 32-bit DRI libraries and clients.  All the userland stuff is
    identical to what I am using under a 32-bit kernel on my G4 powerbook
    (which is a 32-bit machine of course).  I haven't tried compiling up a
    64-bit X server or clients yet.
    
    In the compatibility routines I have assumed that the kernel can
    safely access user addresses after set_fs(KERNEL_DS).  That is, where
    an ioctl argument structure contains pointers to other structures, and
    those other structures are already compatible between the 32-bit and
    64-bit ABIs (i.e. they only contain things like chars, shorts or
    ints), I just check the address with access_ok() and then pass it
    through to the 64-bit ioctl code.  I believe this approach may not
    work on sparc64, but it does work on ppc64 and x86_64 at least.
    
    One tricky area which may need to be revisited is the question of how
    to handle the handles which we pass back to userspace to identify
    mappings.  These handles are generated in the ADDMAP ioctl and then
    passed in as the offset value to mmap.  However, offset values for
    mmap seem to be generated in other ways as well, particularly for AGP
    mappings.
    
    The approach I have ended up with is to generate a fake 32-bit handle
    only for _DRM_SHM mappings.  The handles for other mappings (AGP, REG,
    FB) are physical addresses which are already limited to 32 bits, and
    generating fake handles for them created all sorts of problems in the
    mmap/nopage code.
    
    This patch has been updated to use the new compatibility ioctls.

    [PATCH] Maple powerdown patch
    
    Currently reset and powerdown are not implemented on the Maple board,
    and attempting to do so will (incorrectly return).  This implements
    the proper communication with the service processor, allowing correct
    reset and powerdown on the Maple board, by communicating with the
    service processor.  If somehow it's unable to communicate with the
    service processor it will loop forever instead.
    
    Note that powerdown on the Maple will power down the CPUs, but not the
    fans or other board components due to hardware and firmware
    limitations.

    [PATCH] pSeries - read irqs dynamically
    
    For I/O DLPAR to work properly, the kernel needs to allow for dynamic
    assignment of the irq field of the pci_dev structure upon dynamic bus
    addition.  This patch moves the assignment of that field from
    pSeries_final_fixup() to pcibios_fixup_bus(), which enables dynamic
    assignment for the children of a newly added bus.
    
    Currently, pci_devs receive their irq numbers in one of two ways.  The
    irq line is either read at boot for all pci_devs, or read by the rpaphp
    module at slot enable time.  The latter is no longer sufficient for
    DLPAR addition of slots that don't qualify as PCI-hotplug capable.
    This solution handles the cases of boot and dynamic add.

    [PATCH] correct printing to operator panel
    
    This patch corrects the printing of progress indicators to the op
    panel on p/iSeries ppc64 systems.  Each discrete reference code should
    begin with a form feed char to clear the op panel, and the first and
    second lines should be separated with a CR/LF sequence.  Padding with
    spaces is not necessary.
    
    Also, capitalize the hex value printed on the first line, to be
    consistent with the values printed by firmware, service processor,
    etc.
    
    It turns out that there's an ibm,form-feed property; this patch uses
    it in the pSeries-specific progress routine.  This patch also checks
    the number of rows and the specific width of each row (the second row
    on power5 systems can actually hold 80 characters).  If the displayed
    text is too wide for the physical display, it can be viewed in the ASM
    menus, or by selecting option 14 on the op panel.

    [X25]: Fast select with no restriction on response
    
    This patch is a follow up to patch 1 regarding "Selective Sub Address
    matching with call user data".  It allows use of the Fast-Select-Acceptance
    optional user facility for X.25.
    
    This patch just implements fast select with no restriction on response
    (NRR).  What this means (according to ITU-T Recomendation 10/96 section
    6.16) is that if in an incoming call packet, the relevant facility bits are
    set for fast-select-NRR, then the called DTE can issue a direct response to
    the incoming packet using a call-accepted packet that contains
    call-user-data.  This patch allows such a response.
    
    The called DTE can also respond with a clear-request packet that contains
    call-user-data.  However, this feature is currently not implemented by the
    patch.
    
    How is Fast Select Acceptance used?
    By default, the system does not allow fast select acceptance (as before).
    To enable a response to fast select acceptance,
    After a listen socket in created and bound as follows
    	socket(AF_X25, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
    	bind(call_soc, (struct sockaddr *)&locl_addr, sizeof(locl_addr));
    but before a listen system call is made, the following ioctl should be used.
    	ioctl(call_soc,SIOCX25CALLACCPTAPPRV);
    Now the listen system call can be made
    	listen(call_soc, 4);
    After this, an incoming-call packet will be accepted, but no call-accepted
    packet will be sent back until the following system call is made on the socket
    that accepts the call
    	ioctl(vc_soc,SIOCX25SENDCALLACCPT);
    The network (or cisco xot router used for testing here) will allow the
    application server's call-user-data in the call-accepted packet,
    provided the call-request was made with Fast-select NRR.

    [X25]: Selective sub-address matching with call user data.
    
    From: Shaun Pereira <spereira@tusc.com.au>
    
    This is the first (independent of the second) patch of two that I am
    working on with x25 on linux (tested with xot on a cisco router).  Details
    are as follows.
    
    Current state of module:
    
    A server using the current implementation (2.6.11.7) of the x25 module will
    accept a call request/ incoming call packet at the listening x.25 address,
    from all callers to that address, as long as NO call user data is present
    in the packet header.
    
    If the server needs to choose to accept a particular call request/ incoming
    call packet arriving at its listening x25 address, then the kernel has to
    allow a match of call user data present in the call request packet with its
    own.  This is required when multiple servers listen at the same x25 address
    and device interface.  The kernel currently matches ALL call user data, if
    present.
    
    Current Changes:
    
    This patch is a follow up to the patch submitted previously by Andrew
    Hendry, and allows the user to selectively control the number of octets of
    call user data in the call request packet, that the kernel will match.  By
    default no call user data is matched, even if call user data is present.
    To allow call user data matching, a cudmatchlength > 0 has to be passed
    into the kernel after which the passed number of octets will be matched.
    Otherwise the kernel behavior is exactly as the original implementation.
    
    This patch also ensures that as is normally the case, no call user data
    will be present in the Call accepted / call connected packet sent back to
    the caller
    
    Future Changes on next patch:
    
    There are cases however when call user data may be present in the call
    accepted packet.  According to the X.25 recommendation (ITU-T 10/96)
    section 5.2.3.2 call user data may be present in the call accepted packet
    provided the fast select facility is used.  My next patch will include this
    fast select utility and the ability to send up to 128 octets call user data
    in the call accepted packet provided the fast select facility is used.  I
    am currently testing this, again with xot on linux and cisco.

    [NETPOLL]: allow multiple netpoll_clients to register against one interface
    
    This patch provides support for registering multiple netpoll clients to the
    same network device.  Only one of these clients may register an rx_hook,
    however.  In practice, this restriction has not been problematic.  It is
    worth mentioning, though, that the current design can be easily extended to
    allow for the registration of multiple rx_hooks.
    
    The basic idea of the patch is that the rx_np pointer in the netpoll_info
    structure points to the struct netpoll that has rx_hook filled in.  Aside
    from this one case, there is no need for a pointer from the struct
    net_device to an individual struct netpoll.
    
    A lock is introduced to protect the setting and clearing of the np_rx
    pointer.  The pointer will only be cleared upon netpoll client module
    removal, and the lock should be uncontested.

    [NETPOLL]: Introduce a netpoll_info struct
    
    This patch introduces a netpoll_info structure, which the struct net_device
    will now point to instead of pointing to a struct netpoll.  The reason for
    this is two-fold: 1) fields such as the rx_flags, poll_owner, and poll_lock
    should be maintained per net_device, not per netpoll;  and 2) this is a first
    step in providing support for multiple netpoll clients to register against the
    same net_device.
    
    The struct netpoll is now pointed to by the netpoll_info structure.  As
    such, the previous behaviour of the code is preserved.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Add driver for BPA iommu
    
    Implementation of software load support for the BE iommu. This is very
    different from other iommu code on ppc64, since we only do a static mapping.
    The mapping is currently hardcoded but should really be read from the
    firmware, but they don't set up the device nodes yet. There is a single
    512MB DMA window for PCI, USB and ethernet at 0x20000000 for our RAM.
    
    The Cell processor can put the I/O page table either in memory like
    the hashed page table (hardware load) or have the operating system
    write the entries into memory mapped CPU registers (software load).
    
    I use the software load mechanism because I know that all I/O page
    table entries for the amount of installed physical memory fit into
    the IO TLB cache. At the point when we get machines with more than
    4GB of installed memory, we can either use hardware I/O page table
    access like the other platforms do or dynamically update the I/O
    TLB entries when a page fault occurs in the I/O subsystem.
    
    The software load can then use the macros that I have implemented
    for the static mapping in order to do the TLB cache updates.

    PIC that exists.

    The pSeries_progress function is called from some places in the rtas code,

    Though pSeries is currently the only platform type that implements
    display-character, the code is actually generic enough to be part of
    the rtas subsystem.
    
    I hit a bug here because the generic rtas code tried calling ppc_md.progress,
    which points to an __init function on most platforms.
    
    We could also clear the ppc_md.progress pointer when freeing the init memory
    to make it more explicit that ppc_md.progress must not be called after
    bootup.

    files, so I'm moving those as well.
    
    It makes sense to merge this with the pmac function of the

    iSeries and one for Open Firmware based machines.

    [CRYPTO]: Use CPU cycle counters in tcrypt
    
    After using this facility for a while to test my changes to the
    cipher crypt() layer, I realised that I should've listend to Dave
    and made this thing use CPU cycle counters :) As it is it's too
    jittery for me to feel safe about relying on the results.
    
    So here is a patch to make it use CPU cycles by default but fall
    back to jiffies if the user specifies a non-zero sec value.

    [CRYPTO]: Add cipher speed tests
    
    From: Reyk Floeter <reyk@vantronix.net>
    
    I recently had the requirement to do some benchmarking on cryptoapi, and
    I found reyk's very useful performance test patch [1].
    
    However, I could not find any discussion on why that extension (or
    something providing a similar feature but different implementation) was
    not merged into mainline.  If there was such a discussion, can someone
    please point me to the archive[s]?
    
    I've now merged the old patch into 2.6.12-rc1, the result can be found
    attached to this email.

    [PATCH] RPC: kick off socket connect operations faster
    
     Make the socket transport kick the event queue to start socket connects
     immediately.  This should improve responsiveness of applications that are
     sensitive to slow mount operations (like automounters).
    
     We are now also careful to cancel the connect worker before destroying
     the xprt.  This eliminates a race where xprt_destroy can finish before
     the connect worker is even allowed to run.
    
     Test-plan:
     Destructive testing (unplugging the network temporarily).  Connectathon
     with UDP and TCP.  Hard-code impossibly small connect timeout.

     When the network layer reports a connection close, the RPC task

    [PATCH] NFS: Cache the NFSv3 acls.
    
     Attach acls to inodes in the icache to avoid unnecessary GETACL RPC
     round-trips.  As long as the client doesn't retrieve any acls itself, only the
     default acls of exiting directories and the default and access acls of new
     directories will end up in the cache, which preserves some memory compared to
     always caching the access and default acl of all files.

    [PATCH] NFS: Fix handling of the umask when an NFSv3 default acl is present.
    
     NFSv3 has no concept of a umask on the server side: The client applies
     the umask locally, and sends the effective permissions to the server.
     This behavior is wrong when files are created in a directory that has a
     default ACL.  In this case, the umask is supposed to be ignored, and
     only the default ACL determines the file's effective permissions.
    
     Usually its the server's task to conditionally apply the umask.  But
     since the server knows nothing about the umask, we have to do it on the
     client side.  This patch tries to fetch the parent directory's default
     ACL before creating a new file, computes the appropriate create mode to
     send to the server, and finally sets the new file's access and default
     acl appropriately.
    
     Many thanks to Buck Huppmann <buchk@pobox.com> for sending the initial
     version of this patch, as well as for arguing why we need this change.

    [PATCH] NFS: Add support for NFSv3 ACLs
    
     This adds acl support fo nfs clients via the NFSACL protocol extension, by
     implementing the getxattr, listxattr, setxattr, and removexattr iops for the
     system.posix_acl_access and system.posix_acl_default attributes.  This patch
     implements a dumb version that uses no caching (and thus adds some overhead).
     (Another patch in this patchset adds caching as well.)

    [ALSA] cs4236-irq-handling-fix.patch
    
    CS4236+ driver
    Background: The card/chipset supports an external MIDI interrupt.  By
    default, this interrupt isn't used (because the isapnp mechanism chooses a
    configuration without an assigned interrupt).  If the user wishes to
    explicitly select an interrupt via the mpu_irq parameter for such a
    configured device, it doesn't work: The driver always shows:
    
    isapnp MPU: port=0x330, irq=-1
    
    (note the 'irq=-1')
    
    Problem: The driver only allows to set the irq if pnp_irq_valid returns
    true for this particular pnp device.  This, however, is only true if an
    interrupt has already been assigned (pnp_valid_irq returns true if the flag
    IORESOURCE_IRQ is set and IORESOURCE_UNSET is not set).  If no interrupt
    has been assigned so far, IORESOURCE_UNSET is set and pnp_irq_valid returns
    false, thereby inhibiting the selection of a valid irq.
    
    Solution: Don't check for a valid (= already assigned) irq at the point of
    calling pnp_resource_change.
    
    Tested successfully on Linux 2.6.11.

    i2c: Race fix for i2c-mpc.c
    
    The problem was that the clock speed and driver data is
    initialized after the i2c adapter was added. This caused
    the i2c bus to start working at a wrong speed. (Mostly
    noticable on the second bus on mpc5200)
    
    With this patch we've tried to keep the i2c adapter
    working perfectly all the time it is included in the system.
    Initialize before added, Remove garbage after deleleted.

    [PATCH] I2C: Setting w83627hf fan divisor 128 fails.
    
    Jarkko Lavinen provided patch to fix: "couldn't set the divisor 128
    through fan1_div sysfs entry even though the chip supports it and
    setting divisors 1..64 worked. This was due to POWER_TO_REG() only
    checking 2's powers 0 till 5 but not 6."

    [PATCH] I2C: New hardware monitoring driver: w83627ehf
    
    This is a new hardware monitoring driver, w83627ehf, which supports the
    Winbond W83627EHF Super-I/O chip. The driver is not complete, but
    already usable. It only implements fan speed and temperature monitoring,
    while the chip also supports voltage inputs with VID, PWM output and
    temperature sensor selection. I have no more time to work on this, but
    anyone with supported hardware could add the missing functionalities
    later.
    
    This driver is largely derived from the w83627hf driver.
    
    Thanks to Leon Moonen and Steve Cliffe for tesing the preliminary
    versions of my driver and reporting the problems they encountered.
    
    Thanks to Grant Coady for noticing and fixing various corner cases in
    the fan management. This third version of the driver hopefully addresses
    all the issues the original version had.

    I agree. This won't change anything though, as all drivers include
    either device.h or module.h, which in turn include config.h. But you are
    still correct, so I approve your patch.
    
    For completeness, I would propose the following on top of your own
    patch:
    
    i2c bus drivers do not need to define DEBUG themselves, as the Kconfig
    system takes care of it.

    On top of my previous patch which removes the use of address ranges in

    Most of these drivers which do not use I2C_CLIENT_INSMOD initialize the
    unused address lists in a less than optimal way. This patch simply
    optimizes this, by using a single one-element list instead of 3
    different lists with two elements each.
    
    This saves an average 63 bytes on these drivers.

    [PATCH] I2C: Kill address ranges in non-sensors i2c chip drivers
    
    Some months ago, you killed the address ranges mechanism from all
    sensors i2c chip drivers (both the module parameters and the in-code
    address lists). I think it was a very good move, as the ranges can
    easily be replaced by individual addresses, and this allowed for
    significant cleanups in the i2c core (let alone the impressive size
    shrink for all these drivers).
    
    Unfortunately you did not do the same for non-sensors i2c chip drivers.
    These need the address ranges even less, so we could get rid of the
    ranges here as well for another significant i2c core cleanup. Here comes
    a patch which does just that. Since the process is exactly the same as
    what you did for the other drivers set already, I did not split this one
    in parts.
    
    A documentation update is included.
    
    The change saves 308 bytes in the i2c core, and an average 1382 bytes
    for chip drivers which use I2C_CLIENT_INSMOD, 126 bytes for those which
    do not.
    
    This change is required if we want to merge the sensors and non-sensors
    i2c code (and we want to do this).

    I've created reconnect feature - if on start there are no registered families
    all new devices will have defailt family, later when driver for appropriate
    family is loaded, slaves, which were faound earlier, will still have defult
    family instead of right one. Reconnect feature will force control thread to run
    through all master devices and all slaves found and search for slaves with
    default family id and try to reconnect them.
    
    It does not store newly registered family and does not check only those slaves
    which have reg_num.family the same as being registered one - all slaves with
    default family are reconnected.

    [PATCH] md: allow md to update multiple superblocks in parallel.
    
    currently, md updates all superblocks (one on each device) in series.  It
    waits for one write to complete before starting the next.  This isn't a big
    problem as superblock updates don't happen that often.
    
    However it is neater to do it in parallel, and if the drives in the array have
    gone to "sleep" after a period of idleness, then waking them is parallel is
    faster (and someone else should be worrying about power drain).
    
    Futher, we will need parallel superblock updates for a future patch which
    keeps the intent-logging bitmap near the superblock.
    
    Also remove the silly code that retired superblock updates 100 times.  This
    simply never made sense.

    [PATCH] md: fix deadlock due to md thread processing delayed requests.
    
    Before completing a 'write' the md superblock might need to be updated.
    This is best done by the md_thread.
    
    The current code schedules this up and queues the write request for later
    handling by the md_thread.
    
    However some personalities (Raid5/raid6) will deadlock if the md_thread
    tries to submit requests to its own array.
    
    So this patch changes things so the processes submitting the request waits
    for the superblock to be written and then submits the request itself.
    
    This fixes a recently-created deadlock in raid5/raid6

    [PATCH] md: make sure md bitmap is cleared on a clean start.
    
    As the array-wide clean bit (in the superblock) is set more agressively than
    the bits in the bitmap are cleared, it is possible to have an array which is
    clean despite there being bits set in the bitmap.
    
    These bits will currently never get cleared, as they can only be cleared by a
    resync pass, which never happens.
    
    No, when reading bits from disk, be aware of whether the whole array is known
    to be in sync, and act accordingly.

    [PATCH] md: optimised resync using Bitmap based intent logging
    
    With this patch, the intent to write to some block in the array can be logged
    to a bitmap file.  Each bit represents some number of sectors and is set
    before any update happens, and only cleared when all writes relating to all
    sectors are complete.
    
    After an unclean shutdown, information in this bitmap can be used to optimise
    resync - only sectors which could be out-of-sync need to be updated.
    
    Also if a drive is removed and then added back into an array, the recovery can
    make use of the bitmap to optimise reconstruction.  This is not implemented in
    this patch.
    
    Currently the bitmap is stored in a file which must (obviously) be stored on a
    separate device.
    
    The patch only provided infrastructure.  It does not update any personalities
    to bitmap intent logging.
    
    Md arrays can still be used with no bitmap file.  This patch has minimal
    impact on such arrays.

     in an int, but if resync needs to abort, it may want to return
     the total number of remaining sectors, which could be large.
     Also errors cannot be returned as negative numbers now, so use
     0 instead
    2/ Add a 'skipped' return parameter to allow the array to report
     that it skipped the sectors.  This allows md to take this into account
     in the speed calculations.
     Currently there is no important skipping, but the bitmap-based-resync
     that is coming will use this.

    [PATCH] md: improve locking on 'safemode' and move superblock writes
    
    When md marks the superblock dirty before a write, it calls
    generic_make_request (to write the superblock) from within
    generic_make_request (to write the first dirty block), which could cause
    problems later.
    
    With this patch, the superblock write is always done by the helper thread, and
    write request are delayed until that write completes.
    
    Also, the locking around marking the array dirty and writing the superblock is
    improved to avoid possible races.

    [PATCH] md: merge md_enter_safemode into md_check_recovery
    
    md_enter_safemode checks if it is time to mark the md superblock as 'clean'.
    i.e.  if all writes have completed and a suitable delay has passed.
    
    This is currently called from md_handle_safemode which in-turn is called
    (almost) every time md_check_recovery is called, and from the end of
    md_do_sync which causes the mddev->thread to run, which will always call
    md_check_recovery as well.
    
    So it doesn't need to be a separate function and fits quite well into
    md_check_recovery.
    
    The "almost" is because multipathd calls md_check_recovery but not
    md_handle_safemode.  This is OK because the code from md_enter_safemode is a
    no-op if mddev->safemode == 0, which it always is for a multipathd (providing
    we don't allow it to be set to 2 on a signal...)

    on the vga8x16 font).
    
    This patch is non-intrusive, no options are enabled by default so most

    I am placing my changes under the GPL, however, I've not seen any copyright
    notices on the sun12x22 font and the vga8x16 font which I derived my new
    fonts from so I don't know what the copyright status is.

    [PATCH] VGA to fbcon fix.
    
    Currently when going from vgacon to fbcon the VT screenbuffer are often
    different sizes.  In the case when they are different sizes a new VT
    screenbuffer is allocated and the contents are copied into the new buffer.
    
    Currently the amount copied from VGA text memory to the new screenbuf is
    the size of the framebuffer console.  If the framebuffer console new VT
    screen buffer is greater than the VGA text memory size then we get some of
    the VGA BIOS contents as well.
    
    This patch will only allow you to copy up to the size of VGA text memory
    now.  The rest is filled with erase characters.

    [PATCH] s1d13xxxfb linkage fix
    
    s1d13xxxfb_remove() is referenced from s1d13xxxfb_probe(), which is marked
    __devinit().  So s1d13xxxfb_remove() cannot be marked __devexit.
    
    Does this all make sense?  Clearly the __devexit section will still be in
    core when the __devinit code is run, if the driver was loaded as a module.
    
    But I suppose that if the driver is statically linked, the __devexit section
    might be dropped early in boot.  Still, we wouldn't drop __devexit prior to
    initcall completion, at which point the __devinit code has all been run
    anyway.
    
    verdict: this code was legal and made sense.  Is this a generic problem, or an
    arm-specific problem?

    [PATCH] isofs: show hidden files, add granularity for assoc/hidden files flags
    
    The current isofs treatment of hidden files is flawed in two ways.  First,
    it does not provide sufficient granularity; it hides both 'hidden' files
    and 'associated' files (resource fork for Mac files).  Second, the default
    behavior to completely strip hidden files, while an admirable
    implementation of the spec, is a poor choice given the real world use of
    hidden files as a poor mans copy protection scheme for MSDOS and Windows
    based systems.  A longer description of this is available here:
    
       http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0205.3/0267.html
    
    This patch was originally built after a few private conversations with Alan
    Cox; I shamefully failed to persist in seeing it go forward, I hope to make
    amends now.
    
    This patch introduces granularity by allowing explicit control for both
    hidden and associated files.  It also reverses the default so that by
    default, hidden files are treated as regular files on the iso9660 file
    system.
    
    This allow Wine to process Windows CDs, including those that are hybrid
    Mac/Windows CDs properly and completely, without our having to go muck up
    peoples fstabs as we do now.  (I have tested this with such a hybrid +
    hidden CD and have verified that this patch works as claimed).

    [PATCH] rock.c: handle corrupted directories
    
    The bug in rock.c is that it's totally trusting of the contents of the
    directories.  If the directory says there's a continuation 10000 bytes into
    this 4k block then we cheerily poke around in memory we don't own and oops.
    
    So change rock_continue() to apply various sanity checks, at least ensuring
    that the offset+length remain within the bounds for the header part of a
    struct rock_ridge directory entry.
    
    Note that the kernel can still overindex the buffer due to the variable size
    of the rock-ridge directory entries.  We cannot check that in rock_continue()
    unless we go parse the directory entry's signature and work out its size.

    [PATCH] autofs4: bad lookup fix
    
    For browsable autofs maps, a mount request that arrives at the same time an
    expire is happening can fail to perform the needed mount.
    
    This happens becuase the directory exists and so the revalidate succeeds when
    we need it to fail so that lookup is called on the same dentry to do the
    mount.  Instead lookup is called on the next path component which should be
    whithin the mount, but the parent isn't mounted.
    
    The solution is to allow the revalidate to continue and perform the mount as
    no directory creation (at mount time) is needed for browsable mount entries.

    [PATCH] autofs4: post expire race fix
    
    At the tail end of an expire it's possible for a process to enter
    autofs4_wait, with a waitq type of NFY_NONE but find that the expire is
    finished.  In this cause autofs4_wait will try to create a new wait but not
    notify the daemon leading to a hang.  As the wait type is meant to delay mount
    requests from revalidate or lookup during an expire and the expire is done all
    we need to do is check if the dentry is a mountpoint.  If it's not then we're
    done.

    [PATCH] ibmasm driver: redesign handling of remote control events
    
    This patch rewrites the handling of remote control events.  Rather than making
    them available from a special file in the ibmasmfs, now the events from the
    RSA card get translated into kernel input events and injected into the input
    subsystem.  The driver now will generate two /dev/input/eventX nodes -- one
    for the keyboard and one for the mouse.  The mouse node generates absolute
    events more like a touch pad than a mouse.

    [PATCH] s390: memory detection > 32GB
    
    The kernel takes a very long time to boot if the memory size is bigger then
    32767 MB.  The memory size is contained in a structure created by an sclp
    call.  The kernel accesses the field with a LH instrution which performs a
    sign extension of a 16 bit word.  In the case of a memory size with bit 2^15
    set this results in a very large value and the memory detection just loops for
    a long time.  In addition if more then 64 GB are used on a 64 bit system the
    memory size is read from an incorrect storage location.
    
    Use zero-extention to read the 16 bit memory size and the correct offset to
    read the 4 byte memory size on 64 bit.

    [PATCH] uml: fix linkage of tt mode against NPTL
    
    With Al Viro <viro@www.linux.org.uk>
    
    To make sure switcheroo() can execute when we remap all the executable
    image, we used a trick to make it use a local copy of errno...  this trick
    does not work with NPTL glibc, only with LinuxThreads, so use another
    (simpler) one to make it work anyway.
    
    Hopefully, a lot improved thanks to merging with the version of Al Viro
    (which had his part of problems, though, i.e.  removing a fix to another
    bug and not fixing the problem on i386).

    [PATCH] uml: add and use generic hw_controller_type->release
    
    With Chris Wedgwood <cw@f00f.org>
    
    Currently UML must explicitly call the UML-specific
    free_irq_by_irq_and_dev() for each free_irq call it's done.
    
    This is needed because ->shutdown and/or ->disable are only called when the
    last "action" for that irq is removed.
    
    Instead, for UML shared IRQs (UML IRQs are very often, if not always,
    shared), for each dev_id some setup is done, which must be cleared on the
    release of that fd.  For instance, for each open console a new instance
    (i.e.  new dev_id) of the same IRQ is requested().
    
    Exactly, a fd is stored in an array (pollfds), which is after read by a
    host thread and passed to poll().  Each event registered by poll() triggers
    an interrupt.  So, for each free_irq() we must remove the corresponding
    host fd from the table, which we do via this -release() method.
    
    In this patch we add an appropriate hook for this, and remove all uses of
    it by pointing the hook to the said procedure; this is safe to do since the
    said procedure.
    
    Also some cosmetic improvements are included.
    
    This is heavily based on some work by Chris Wedgwood, which however didn't
    get the patch merged for something I'd call a "misunderstanding" (the need
    for this patch wasn't cleanly explained, thus adding the generic hook was
    felt as undesirable).

    [PATCH] ioc4: PCI bus speed detection
    
    Several hardware features of SGI's IOC4 I/O controller chip require
    timing-related driver calculations dependent upon the PCI bus speed.  This
    patch enables the core IOC4 driver code to detect the actual bus speed and
    store a value that can later be used by the IOC4 subdrivers as needed.

    [PATCH] ioc4: CONFIG split
    
    The SGI IOC4 I/O controller chip drivers are currently all configured by
    CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SGIIOC4.  This is undesirable as not all IOC4 hardware features
    are needed by all systems.
    
    This patch adds two configuration variables, CONFIG_SGI_IOC4 for core IOC4
    driver support (see patch 1/3 in this series for further explanation) and
    CONFIG_SERIAL_SGI_IOC4 to independently enable serial port support.

    [PATCH] ioc4: Core driver rewrite
    
    This series of patches reworks the configuration and internal structure
    of the SGI IOC4 I/O controller device drivers.
    
    These changes are motivated by several factors:
    
    - The IOC4 chip PCI resources are of mixed use between functions (i.e.
      multiple functions are handled in the same address range, sometimes
      within the same register), muddling resource ownership and initialization
      issues.  Centralizing this ownership in a core driver is desirable.
    
    - The IOC4 chip implements multiple functions (serial, IDE, others not
      yet implemented in the mainline kernel) but is not a multifunction
      PCI device.  In order to properly handle device addition and removal
      as well as module insertion and deletion, an intermediary IOC4-specific
      driver layer is needed to handle these operations cleanly.
    
    - All IOC4 drivers are currently enabled by a single CONFIG value.  As
      not all systems need all IOC4 functions, it is desireable to enable
      these drivers independently.
    
    - The current IOC4 core driver will trigger loading of all function-level
      drivers, as it makes direct calls to them.  This situation should be
      reversed (i.e. function-level drivers cause loading of core driver)
      in order to maintain a clear and least-surprise driver loading model.
    
    - IOC4 hardware design necessitates some driver-level dependency on
      the PCI bus clock speed.  Current code assumes a 66MHz bus, but the
      speed should be autodetected and appropriate compensation taken.
    
    This patch series effects the above changes by a newly and better designed
    IOC4 core driver with which the function-level drivers can register and
    deregister themselves upon module insertion/removal.  By tracking these
    modules, device addition/removal is also handled properly.  PCI resource
    management and ownership issues are centralized in this core driver, and
    IOC4-wide configuration actions such as bus speed detection are also
    handled in this core driver.
    
    This patch:
    
    The SGI IOC4 I/O controller chip implements multiple functions, though it is
    not a multi-function PCI device.  Additionally, various PCI resources of the
    IOC4 are shared by multiple hardware functions, and thus resource ownership by
    driver is not clearly delineated.  Due to the current driver design, all core
    and subordinate drivers must be loaded, or none, which is undesirable if not
    all IOC4 hardware features are being used.
    
    This patch reorganizes the IOC4 drivers so that the core driver provides a
    subdriver registration service.  Through appropriate callbacks the subdrivers
    can now handle device addition and removal, as well as module insertion and
    deletion (though the IOC4 IDE driver requires further work before module
    deletion will work).  The core driver now takes care of allocating PCI
    resources and data which must be shared between subdrivers, to clearly
    delineate module ownership of these items.

    reuse it for the iSeries "generic" vio device (that is used for passing to
    dma routines when communicating with the hypervisor without a device
    involved).  Also unexport vio_bus_type as it is never used in modules.

    [PATCH] ppc64 iSeries: obvious code simplifications
    
    This patch does some obvious code cleanups in the iSeries headers files.
    	- simplifies the bodies of lots of inline functions
    	- parenthesises a macros result
    	- removes C++ wrapping
    	- adds "extern" to some function declarations
    There are no semantic changes.

    [PATCH] ppc64: override command line AS/LD/CC variables when adding -m64 and co for biarch compilers
    
    The following kind of calls currently fails :
    
      make ARCH=ppc64 CC="gcc-3.4"
    
    Since the code for detecting a biarch compiler and adding the needed 64bit
    magic argument fails if the AS/LD/CC commands are overriden in the command
    line.
    
    The attached patch fixes this by using the make override and += directive,
    but i am not 100% sure this will work without gmake, as i am no Makefile
    expert.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Abolish ioremap_mm
    
    Currently ppc64 has two mm_structs for the kernel, init_mm and also
    ioremap_mm.  The latter really isn't necessary: this patch abolishes it,
    instead restricting vmallocs to the lower 1TB of the init_mm's range and
    placing io mappings in the upper 1TB.  This simplifies the code in a number
    of places and eliminates an unecessary set of pagetables.  It also tweaks
    the unmap/free path a little, allowing us to remove the unmap_im_area() set
    of page table walkers, replacing them with unmap_vm_area().

    [PATCH] ppc32: Added support for all MPC8548 internal interrupts
    
    The MPC8548 has 48 internal interrupts and 12 external interrupts.  The
    previous generation PowerQUICC III devices only had 32 internal and 12
    external interrupts on the primary interrupt controller.
    
    Expanded the number of internal interrupts to 48 for all PowerQUICC III
    processors and moved the interrupt numbers for the external after the 48
    internal interrupt lines, rather than putting the 12 new internal
    interrupts at the end and ifdef'ng the whole mess.  As parted of this
    created a macro which represents the internal interrupt senses since they
    are the same on all PQ3 processors.

    [PATCH] msync: check pte dirty earlier
    
    It's common practice to msync a large address range regularly, in which
    often only a few ptes have actually been dirtied since the previous pass.
    
    sync_pte_range then goes much faster if it tests whether pte is dirty
    before locating and accessing each struct page cacheline; and it is hardly
    slowed by ptep_clear_flush_dirty repeating that test in the opposite case,
    when every pte actually is dirty.
    
    But beware, s390's pte_dirty always says false, since its dirty bit is kept
    in the storage key, located via the struct page address.  So skip this
    optimization in its case: use a pte_maybe_dirty macro which just says true
    if page_test_and_clear_dirty is implemented.

    [PATCH] can_share_swap_page: use page_mapcount
    
    Remember that ironic get_user_pages race?  when the raised page_count on a
    page swapped out led do_wp_page to decide that it had to copy on write, so
    substituted a different page into userspace.  2.6.7 onwards have Andrea's
    solution, where try_to_unmap_one backs out if it finds page_count raised.
    
    Which works, but is unsatisfying (rmap.c has no other page_count heuristics),
    and was found a few months ago to hang an intensive page migration test.  A
    year ago I was hesitant to engage page_mapcount, now it seems the right fix.
    
    So remove the page_count hack from try_to_unmap_one; and use activate_page in
    unuse_mm when dropping lock, to replace its secondary effect of helping
    swapoff to make progress in that case.
    
    Simplify can_share_swap_page (now called only on anonymous pages) to check
    page_mapcount + page_swapcount == 1: still needs the page lock to stabilize
    their (pessimistic) sum, but does not need swapper_space.tree_lock for that.
    
    In do_swap_page, move swap_free and unlock_page below page_add_anon_rmap, to
    keep sum on the high side, and correct when can_share_swap_page called.

    [PATCH] do_wp_page: cannot share file page
    
    A small optimization to do_wp_page's check for whether to avoid copy by
    reusing the page already mapped.  It can never share a cached file page,
    nor can it share a reserved page (often the empty zero page), so it's a
    waste of time to lock and unlock in those cases.  Which nowadays can both
    be neatly excluded by a preliminary PageAnon test.
    
    Christoph has reported that a preliminary page_count test proved valuable
    for scalability here, but PageAnon covers more common cases all at once.

    [PATCH] get_user_pages: kill get_page_map
    
    Since its birth, get_user_pages has been calling a misguided get_page_map
    function.  follow_page has already returned NULL if the pfn is invalid, we
    cannot reach an invalid pfn from a validated struct page.
    
    Remove get_page_map, and the messy rewind in get_user_pages to cope with

    [PATCH] shmem: restore superblock info
    
    To improve shmem scalability, we allowed tmpfs instances which don't need
    their blocks or inodes limited not to count them, and not to allocate any
    sbinfo.  Which was okay when the only use for the sbinfo was accounting
    blocks and inodes; but since then a couple of unrelated projects extending
    tmpfs want to store other data in the sbinfo.  Whether either extension
    reaches mainline is beside the point: I'm guilty of a bad design decision,
    and should restore sbinfo to make any such future extensions easier.
    
    So, once again allocate a shmem_sb_info for every shmem/tmpfs instance, and
    now let max_blocks 0 indicate unlimited blocks, and max_inodes 0 unlimited
    inodes.  Brent Casavant verified (many months ago) that this does not
    perceptibly impact the scalability (since the unlimited sbinfo cacheline is
    repeatedly accessed but only once dirtied).
    
    And merge shmem_set_size into its sole caller shmem_remount_fs.

    [PATCH] ia64 uncached alloc
    
    This patch contains the ia64 uncached page allocator and the generic
    allocator (genalloc).  The uncached allocator was formerly part of the SN2
    mspec driver but there are several other users of it so it has been split
    off from the driver.
    
    The generic allocator can be used by device driver to manage special memory
    etc.  The generic allocator is based on the allocator from the sym53c8xx_2
    driver.
    
    Various users on ia64 needs uncached memory.  The SGI SN architecture requires
    it for inter-partition communication between partitions within a large NUMA
    cluster.  The specific user for this is the XPC code.  Another application is
    large MPI style applications which use it for synchronization, on SN this can
    be done using special 'fetchop' operations but it also benefits non SN
    hardware which may use regular uncached memory for this purpose.  Performance
    of doing this through uncached vs cached memory is pretty substantial.  This
    is handled by the mspec driver which I will push out in a seperate patch.
    
    Rather than creating a specific allocator for just uncached memory I came up
    with genalloc which is a generic purpose allocator that can be used by device
    drivers and other subsystems as they please.  For instance to handle onboard
    device memory.  It was derived from the sym53c7xx_2 driver's allocator which
    is also an example of a potential user (I am refraining from modifying sym2
    right now as it seems to have been under fairly heavy development recently).
    
    On ia64 memory has various properties within a granule, ie.  it isn't safe to
    access memory as uncached within the same granule as currently has memory
    accessed in cached mode.  The regular system therefore doesn't utilize memory
    in the lower granules which is mixed in with device PAL code etc.  The
    uncached driver walks the EFI memmap and pulls out the spill uncached pages
    and sticks them into the uncached pool.  Only after these chunks have been
    utilized, will it start converting regular cached memory into uncached memory.
    Hence the reason for the EFI related code additions.

    - Avoid duplication of pageset initialization code.
    - do the adding to the pageset list before potential free_pages_bulk
      in free_hot_cold_page (otherwise we would have to hold a page
      in a pageset during the period that the boot pagesets are in use).
    - remove mistaken __cpuinitdata attribute and revert back to __initdata
      for the boot pageset. A boot pageset is not necessary for cpu hotplug.

    [PATCH] Periodically drain non local pagesets
    
    The pageset array can potentially acquire a huge amount of memory on large
    NUMA systems.  F.e.  on a system with 512 processors and 256 nodes there
    will be 256*512 pagesets.  If each pageset only holds 5 pages then we are
    talking about 655360 pages.With a 16K page size on IA64 this results in
    potentially 10 Gigabytes of memory being trapped in pagesets.  The typical
    cases are much less for smaller systems but there is still the potential of
    memory being trapped in off node pagesets.  Off node memory may be rarely
    used if local memory is available and so we may potentially have memory in
    seldom used pagesets without this patch.
    
    The slab allocator flushes its per cpu caches every 2 seconds.  The
    following patch flushes the off node pageset caches in the same way by
    tying into the slab flush.
    
    The patch also changes /proc/zoneinfo to include the number of pages
    currently in each pageset.

    [PATCH] Avoiding mmap fragmentation
    
    Ingo recently introduced a great speedup for allocating new mmaps using the
    free_area_cache pointer which boosts the specweb SSL benchmark by 4-5% and
    causes huge performance increases in thread creation.
    
    The downside of this patch is that it does lead to fragmentation in the
    mmap-ed areas (visible via /proc/self/maps), such that some applications
    that work fine under 2.4 kernels quickly run out of memory on any 2.6
    kernel.
    
    The problem is twofold:
    
      1) the free_area_cache is used to continue a search for memory where
         the last search ended.  Before the change new areas were always
         searched from the base address on.
    
         So now new small areas are cluttering holes of all sizes
         throughout the whole mmap-able region whereas before small holes
         tended to close holes near the base leaving holes far from the base
         large and available for larger requests.
    
      2) the free_area_cache also is set to the location of the last
         munmap-ed area so in scenarios where we allocate e.g.  five regions of
         1K each, then free regions 4 2 3 in this order the next request for 1K
         will be placed in the position of the old region 3, whereas before we
         appended it to the still active region 1, placing it at the location
         of the old region 2.  Before we had 1 free region of 2K, now we only
         get two free regions of 1K -> fragmentation.
    
    The patch addresses thes issues by introducing yet another cache descriptor
    cached_hole_size that contains the largest known hole size below the
    current free_area_cache.  If a new request comes in the size is compared
    against the cached_hole_size and if the request can be filled with a hole
    below free_area_cache the search is started from the base instead.
    
    The results look promising: Whereas 2.6.12-rc4 fragments quickly and my
    (earlier posted) leakme.c test program terminates after 50000+ iterations
    with 96 distinct and fragmented maps in /proc/self/maps it performs nicely
    (as expected) with thread creation, Ingo's test_str02 with 20000 threads
    requires 0.7s system time.
    
    Taking out Ingo's patch (un-patch available per request) by basically
    deleting all mentions of free_area_cache from the kernel and starting the
    search for new memory always at the respective bases we observe: leakme
    terminates successfully with 11 distinctive hardly fragmented areas in
    /proc/self/maps but thread creating is gringdingly slow: 30+s(!) system
    time for Ingo's test_str02 with 20000 threads.
    
    Now - drumroll ;-) the appended patch works fine with leakme: it ends with
    only 7 distinct areas in /proc/self/maps and also thread creation seems
    sufficiently fast with 0.71s for 20000 threads.

    [PATCH] node local per-cpu-pages
    
    This patch modifies the way pagesets in struct zone are managed.
    
    Each zone has a per-cpu array of pagesets.  So any particular CPU has some
    memory in each zone structure which belongs to itself.  Even if that CPU is
    not local to that zone.
    
    So the patch relocates the pagesets for each cpu to the node that is nearest
    to the cpu instead of allocating the pagesets in the (possibly remote) target
    zone.  This means that the operations to manage pages on remote zone can be
    done with information available locally.
    
    We play a macro trick so that non-NUMA pmachines avoid the additional
    pointer chase on the page allocator fastpath.

    [PATCH] Hugepage consolidation
    
    A lot of the code in arch/*/mm/hugetlbpage.c is quite similar.  This patch
    attempts to consolidate a lot of the code across the arch's, putting the
    combined version in mm/hugetlb.c.  There are a couple of uglyish hacks in
    order to covert all the hugepage archs, but the result is a very large
    reduction in the total amount of code.  It also means things like hugepage
    lazy allocation could be implemented in one place, instead of six.
    
    Tested, at least a little, on ppc64, i386 and x86_64.
    
    Notes:
    	- this patch changes the meaning of set_huge_pte() to be more
    	  analagous to set_pte()
    	- does SH4 need s special huge_ptep_get_and_clear()??

    [PATCH] VM: rate limit early reclaim
    
    When early zone reclaim is turned on the LRU is scanned more frequently when a
    zone is low on memory.  This limits when the zone reclaim can be called by
    skipping the scan if another thread (either via kswapd or sync reclaim) is
    already reclaiming from the zone.

    [PATCH] VM: add __GFP_NORECLAIM
    
    When using the early zone reclaim, it was noticed that allocating new pages
    that should be spread across the whole system caused eviction of local pages.
    
    This adds a new GFP flag to prevent early reclaim from happening during
    certain allocation attempts.  The example that is implemented here is for page
    cache pages.  We want page cache pages to be spread across the whole system,
    and we don't want page cache pages to evict other pages to get local memory.

    [PATCH] VM: early zone reclaim
    
    This is the core of the (much simplified) early reclaim.  The goal of this
    patch is to reclaim some easily-freed pages from a zone before falling back
    onto another zone.
    
    One of the major uses of this is NUMA machines.  With the default allocator
    behavior the allocator would look for memory in another zone, which might be
    off-node, before trying to reclaim from the current zone.
    
    This adds a zone tuneable to enable early zone reclaim.  It is selected on a
    per-zone basis and is turned on/off via syscall.
    
    Adding some extra throttling on the reclaim was also required (patch
    4/4).  Without the machine would grind to a crawl when doing a "make -j"
    kernel build.  Even with this patch the System Time is higher on
    average, but it seems tolerable.  Here are some numbers for kernbench
    runs on a 2-node, 4cpu, 8Gig RAM Altix in the "make -j" run:
    
    			wall  user   sys   %cpu  ctx sw.  sleeps
    			----  ----   ---   ----   ------  ------
    No patch		1009  1384   847   258   298170   504402
    w/patch, no reclaim     880   1376   667   288   254064   396745
    w/patch & reclaim       1079  1385   926   252   291625   548873
    
    These numbers are the average of 2 runs of 3 "make -j" runs done right
    after system boot.  Run-to-run variability for "make -j" is huge, so
    these numbers aren't terribly useful except to seee that with reclaim
    the benchmark still finishes in a reasonable amount of time.
    
    I also looked at the NUMA hit/miss stats for the "make -j" runs and the
    reclaim doesn't make any difference when the machine is thrashing away.
    
    Doing a "make -j8" on a single node that is filled with page cache pages
    takes 700 seconds with reclaim turned on and 735 seconds without reclaim
    (due to remote memory accesses).

    [PATCH] VM: add may_swap flag to scan_control
    
    Here's the next round of these patches.  These are totally different in
    an attempt to meet the "simpler" request after the last patches.  For
    reference the earlier threads are:
    
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110839604924587&w=2
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm&m=111461480721249&w=2
    
    This set of patches replaces my other vm- patches that are currently in
    -mm.  So they're against 2.6.12-rc5-mm1 about half way through the -mm
    patchset.
    
    As I said already this patch is a lot simpler.  The reclaim is turned on
    or off on a per-zone basis using a syscall.  I haven't tested the x86
    syscall, so it might be wrong.  It uses the existing reclaim/pageout
    code with the small addition of a may_swap flag to scan_control
    (patch 1/4).
    
    I also added __GFP_NORECLAIM (patch 3/4) so that certain allocation
    types can be flagged to never cause reclaim.  This was a deficiency
    that was in all of my earlier patch sets.  Previously, doing a big
    buffered read would fill one zone with page cache and then start to
    reclaim from that same zone, leaving the other zones untouched.
    
    Adding some extra throttling on the reclaim was also required (patch
    4/4).  Without the machine would grind to a crawl when doing a "make -j"
    kernel build.  Even with this patch the System Time is higher on
    average, but it seems tolerable.  Here are some numbers for kernbench
    runs on a 2-node, 4cpu, 8Gig RAM Altix in the "make -j" run:

    w/patch & reclaim       1079  1385   926   252   291625   548873

    (due to remote memory accesses).
    
    The simple zone_reclaim syscall program is at
    http://www.bork.org/~mort/sgi/zone_reclaim.c
    
    This patch:
    
    This adds an extra switch to the scan_control struct.  It simply lets the
    reclaim code know if its allowed to swap pages out.
    
    This was required for a simple per-zone reclaimer.  Without this addition
    pages would be swapped out as soon as a zone ran out of memory and the early
    reclaim kicked in.

    [PATCH] vmscan: notice slab shrinking
    
    Fix a problem identified by Andrea Arcangeli <andrea@suse.de>
    
    kswapd will set a zone into all_unreclaimable state if it sees that we're not
    successfully reclaiming LRU pages.  But that fails to notice that we're
    successfully reclaiming slab obects, so we can set all_unreclaimable too soon.
    
    So change shrink_slab() to return a success indication if it actually
    reclaimed some objects, and don't assume that the zone is all_unreclaimable if
    that is true.  This means that we won't enter all_unreclaimable state if we
    are successfully freeing slab objects but we're not yet actually freeing slab
    pages, due to internal fragmentation.
    
    (hm, this has a shortcoming.  We could be successfully freeing ZONE_NORMAL
    slab objects while being really oom on ZONE_DMA.  If that happens then kswapd
    might burn a lot of CPU.  But given that there might be some slab objects in
    ZONE_DMA, perhaps that is appropriate.)

    [PATCH] smp_processor_id() cleanup
    
    This patch implements a number of smp_processor_id() cleanup ideas that
    Arjan van de Ven and I came up with.
    
    The previous __smp_processor_id/_smp_processor_id/smp_processor_id API
    spaghetti was hard to follow both on the implementational and on the
    usage side.
    
    Some of the complexity arose from picking wrong names, some of the
    complexity comes from the fact that not all architectures defined
    __smp_processor_id.
    
    In the new code, there are two externally visible symbols:
    
     - smp_processor_id(): debug variant.
    
     - raw_smp_processor_id(): nondebug variant. Replaces all existing
       uses of _smp_processor_id() and __smp_processor_id(). Defined
       by every SMP architecture in include/asm-*/smp.h.
    
    There is one new internal symbol, dependent on DEBUG_PREEMPT:
    
     - debug_smp_processor_id(): internal debug variant, mapped to
                                 smp_processor_id().
    
    Also, i moved debug_smp_processor_id() from lib/kernel_lock.c into a new
    lib/smp_processor_id.c file.  All related comments got updated and/or
    clarified.
    
    I have build/boot tested the following 8 .config combinations on x86:
    
     {SMP,UP} x {PREEMPT,!PREEMPT} x {DEBUG_PREEMPT,!DEBUG_PREEMPT}
    
    I have also build/boot tested x64 on UP/PREEMPT/DEBUG_PREEMPT.  (Other
    architectures are untested, but should work just fine.)

    [PATCH] x86_64: TASK_SIZE fixes for compatibility mode processes
    
    Appended patch will setup compatibility mode TASK_SIZE properly.  This will
    fix atleast three known bugs that can be encountered while running
    compatibility mode apps.
    
    a) A malicious 32bit app can have an elf section at 0xffffe000.  During
       exec of this app, we will have a memory leak as insert_vm_struct() is
       not checking for return value in syscall32_setup_pages() and thus not
       freeing the vma allocated for the vsyscall page.  And instead of exec
       failing (as it has addresses > TASK_SIZE), we were allowing it to
       succeed previously.
    
    b) With a 32bit app, hugetlb_get_unmapped_area/arch_get_unmapped_area
       may return addresses beyond 32bits, ultimately causing corruption
       because of wrap-around and resulting in SEGFAULT, instead of returning
       ENOMEM.
    
    c) 32bit app doing this below mmap will now fail.
    
      mmap((void *)(0xFFFFE000UL), 0x10000UL, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
    	MAP_FIXED|MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANON, 0, 0);

    We expect irqs_disabled() to return an int (poor man's bool).

    [SPARC64]: Add prefetch support.
    
    The implementation is optimal for UltraSPARC-III and later.
    It will work, however suboptimally, on UltraSPARC-II and
    be treated as a NOP on UltraSPARC-I.
    
    It is not worth code patching this thing as the highest cost
    is the code space, and code patching cannot eliminate that.

    [IA64] fix nested_dtlb_miss handler for hugetlb address
    
    The nested_dtlb_miss handler currently does not handle fault from
    hugetlb address correctly.  It walks the page table assuming PAGE_SIZE.
    Thus when taking a fault triggered from hugetlb address, it would not
    calculate the pgd/pmd/pte address correctly and thus result an incorrect
    invocation of ia64_do_page_fault().  In there, kernel will signal SIGBUS
    and application dies (The faulting address is perfectly legal and we
    have a valid pte for the corresponding user hugetlb address as well).
    This patch fix the described kernel bug.  Since nested_dtlb_miss is a
    rare event and a slow path anyway, I'm making the change without #ifdef
    CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE for code readability.  Tony, please apply.

    [IPV6]: multicast join and misc
    
    Here is a simplified version of the patch to fix a bug in IPv6
    multicasting. It:
    
    1) adds existence check & EADDRINUSE error for regular joins
    2) adds an exception for EADDRINUSE in the source-specific multicast
            join (where a prior join is ok)
    3) adds a missing/needed read_lock on sock_mc_list; would've raced
            with destroying the socket on interface down without
    4) adds a "leave group" in the (INCLUDE, empty) source filter case.
            This frees unneeded socket buffer memory, but also prevents
            an inappropriate interaction among the 8 socket options that
            mess with this. Some would fail as if in the group when you
            aren't really.
    
    Item #4 had a locking bug in the last version of this patch; rather than
    removing the idev->lock read lock only, I've simplified it to remove
    all lock state in the path and treat it as a direct "leave group" call for
    the (INCLUDE,empty) case it covers. Tested on an MP machine. :-)

    [IPV6]: V6 route events reported with wrong netlink PID and seq number
    
    Essentially netlink at the moment always reports a pid and sequence of 0
    always for v6 route activities.
    To understand the repurcassions of this look at:
    http://lists.quagga.net/pipermail/quagga-dev/2005-June/003507.html
    
    While fixing this, i took the liberty to resolve the outstanding issue
    of IPV6 routes inserted via ioctls to have the correct pids as well.
    
    This patch tries to behave as close as possible to the v4 routes i.e
    maintains whatever PID the socket issuing the command owns as opposed to
    the process. That made the patch a little bulky.
    
    I have tested against both netlink derived utility to add/del routes as
    well as ioctl derived one. The Quagga folks have tested against quagga.
    This fixes the problem and so far hasnt been detected to introduce any
    new issues.

    [PATCH] I2C: drivers/i2c/chips/adm1026.c: use dynamic sysfs callbacks
    
    Finally (phew!) this patch demonstrates how to adapt the adm1026 to
    take advantage of the new callbacks, and the i2c-sysfs.h defined
    structure/macros. Most of the other sensor/hwmon drivers could be
    updated in the same way. The odd few exceptions (bmcsensors for
    example) however might be better off with their own custom attribute
    structure.

    This patch creates a new header with a potential standard i2c sensor

    number/index) and the associated macros, SENSOR_DEVICE_ATTR to define
    a static attribute and to_sensor_dev_attr to get a
    sensor_device_attribute reference from an embedded device_attribute
    reference.

    [PATCH] driver core: fix error handling in bus_add_device
    
    The error handling in bus_add_device() and device_attach() is simply
    non-existing. This patch propagates any error from device_attach to
    the upper layers to allow for a proper recovery.

    [PATCH] libfs: add simple attribute files
    
    Based on the discussion about spufs attributes, this is my suggestion
    for a more generic attribute file support that can be used by both
    debugfs and spufs.
    
    Simple attribute files behave similarly to sequential files from
    a kernel programmers perspective in that a standard set of file
    operations is provided and only an open operation needs to
    be written that registers file specific get() and set() functions.
    
    These operations are defined as
    
    void foo_set(void *data, u64 val); and
    u64 foo_get(void *data);
    
    where data is the inode->u.generic_ip pointer of the file and the
    operations just need to make send of that pointer. The infrastructure
    makes sure this works correctly with concurrent access and partial
    read calls.
    
    A macro named DEFINE_SIMPLE_ATTRIBUTE is provided to further simplify
    using the attributes.
    
    This patch already contains the changes for debugfs to use attributes
    for its internal file operations.

    [PATCH] driver core: Fix races in driver_detach()
    
    This patch is intended for your "driver" tree.  It fixes several subtle
    races in driver_detach() and device_release_driver() in the driver-model
    core.
    
    The major change is to use klist_remove() rather than klist_del() when
    taking a device off its driver's list.  There's no other way to guarantee
    that the list pointers will be updated before some other driver binds to
    the device.  For this to work driver_detach() can't use a klist iterator,
    so the loop over the devices must be written out in full.  In addition the
    patch protects against the possibility that, when a driver and a device
    are unregistered at the same time, one may be unloaded from memory before
    the other is finished using it.

    [PATCH] usb: klist_node_attached() fix
    
    The original code looks like this:
    
            /* if interface was already added, bind now; else let
             * the future device_add() bind it, bypassing probe()
             */
            if (!list_empty (&dev->bus_list))
                    device_bind_driver(dev);
    
    IOW, it's checking to see if the device is attached to the bus or not
    and binding the driver if it is. It's checking the device's bus list,
    which will only appear empty when the device has been initialized, but
    not added. It depends way too much on the driver model internals, but it
    seems to be the only way to do the weird crap they want to do with
    interfaces.
    
    When I converted it to use klists, I accidentally inverted the logic,
    which led to bad things happening. This patch returns the check to its
    orginal value.

    [PATCH] Driver Core: fix bk-driver-core kills ppc64
    
    There's no check to see if the device is already bound to a driver, which
    could do bad things.  The first thing to go wrong is that it will try to match
    a driver with a device already bound to one.  In some cases (it appears with
    USB with drivers/usb/core/usb.c::usb_match_id()), some drivers will match a
    device based on the class type, so it would be common (especially for HID
    devices) to match a device that is already bound.
    
    The fun comes when ->probe() is called, it fails, then
    driver_probe_device() does this:
    
    	dev->driver = NULL;
    
    Later on, that pointer could be be dereferenced without checking and cause
    hell to break loose.
    
    This problem could be nasty. It's very hardware dependent, since some
    devices could have a different set of matching qualifiers than others.
    
    Now, I don't quite see exactly where/how you were getting that crash.
    You're dereferencing bad memory, but I'm not sure which pointer was bad
    and where it came from, but it could have come from a couple of different
    places.
    
    The patch below will hopefully fix it all up for you. It's against
    2.6.12-rc2-mm1, and does the following:
    
    - Move logic to driver_probe_device() and comments uncommon returns:
      1 - If device is bound
      0 - If device not bound, and no error
      error - If there was an error.
    
    - Move locking to caller of that function, since we want to lock a
      device for the entire time we're trying to bind it to a driver (to
      prevent against a driver being loaded at the same time).
    
    - Update __device_attach() and __driver_attach() to do that locking.
    
    - Check if device is already bound in __driver_attach()
    
    - Update the converse device_release_driver() so it locks the device
      around all of the operations.
    
    - Mark driver_probe_device() as static and remove export. It's an
      internal function, it should stay that way, and there are no other
      callers. If there is ever a need to export it, we can audit it as
      necessary.

    Thanks for making the changes. However, changes in functions:
    void pcie_port_device_remove(struct pci_dev *dev) and
    static int remove_iter(struct device *dev, void *data)

    [PATCH] Add initial implementation of klist helpers.
    
    This klist interface provides a couple of structures that wrap around
    struct list_head to provide explicit list "head" (struct klist) and
    list "node" (struct klist_node) objects. For struct klist, a spinlock
    is included that protects access to the actual list itself. struct
    klist_node provides a pointer to the klist that owns it and a kref
    reference count that indicates the number of current users of that node
    in the list.
    
    The entire point is to provide an interface for iterating over a list
    that is safe and allows for modification of the list during the
    iteration (e.g. insertion and removal), including modification of the
    current node on the list.
    
    It works using a 3rd object type - struct klist_iter - that is declared
    and initialized before an iteration. klist_next() is used to acquire the
    next element in the list. It returns NULL if there are no more items.
    This klist interface provides a couple of structures that wrap around
    struct list_head to provide explicit list "head" (struct klist) and
    list "node" (struct klist_node) objects. For struct klist, a spinlock
    is included that protects access to the actual list itself. struct
    klist_node provides a pointer to the klist that owns it and a kref
    reference count that indicates the number of current users of that node
    in the list.

    Internally, that routine takes the klist's lock, decrements the reference
    count of the previous klist_node and increments the count of the next
    klist_node. It then drops the lock and returns.
    
    There are primitives for adding and removing nodes to/from a klist.
    When deleting, klist_del() will simply decrement the reference count.
    Only when the count goes to 0 is the node removed from the list.
    klist_remove() will try to delete the node from the list and block
    until it is actually removed. This is useful for objects (like devices)
    that have been removed from the system and must be freed (but must wait
    until all accessors have finished).

    [PATCH] Move device/driver code to drivers/base/dd.c
    
    This relocates the driver binding/unbinding code to drivers/base/dd.c. This is done
    for two reasons: One, it's not code related to the bus_type itself; it uses some from
    that, some from devices, and some from drivers. And Two, it will make it easier to do
    some of the upcoming lock removal on that code..

    [PATCH] Add a semaphore to struct device to synchronize calls to its driver.
    
    This adds a per-device semaphore that is taken before every call from the core to a
    driver method. This prevents e.g. simultaneous calls to the ->suspend() or ->resume()
    and ->probe() or ->release(), potentially saving a whole lot of headaches.
    
    It also moves us a step closer to removing the bus rwsem, since it protects the fields
    in struct device that are modified by the core.

    [NETLINK]: fib_lookup() via netlink
    
    Below is a more generic patch to do fib_lookup via netlink. For others
    we should say that we discussed this as a way to verify route selection.
    It's also possible there are others uses for this.
    
    In short the fist half of struct fib_result_nl is filled in by caller
    and netlink call fills in the other half and returns it.
    
    In case anyone is interested there is a corresponding user app to compare
    the full routing table this was used to test implementation of the LC-trie.

    [IPSEC]: Add XFRM_STATE_NOPMTUDISC flag
    
    This patch adds the flag XFRM_STATE_NOPMTUDISC for xfrm states.  It is
    similar to the nopmtudisc on IPIP/GRE tunnels.  It only has an effect
    on IPv4 tunnel mode states.  For these states, it will ensure that the
    DF flag is always cleared.
    
    This is primarily useful to work around ICMP blackholes.
    
    In future this flag could also allow a larger MTU to be set within the

    [IPSEC]: Add xfrm_state_afinfo->init_flags
    
    This patch adds the xfrm_state_afinfo->init_flags hook which allows
    each address family to perform any common initialisation that does
    not require a corresponding destructor call.
    
    It will be used subsequently to set the XFRM_STATE_NOPMTUDISC flag
    in IPv4.
    
    It also fixes up the error codes returned by xfrm_init_state.

    [IPSEC]: Add xfrm_init_state
    
    This patch adds xfrm_init_state which is simply a wrapper that calls
    xfrm_get_type and subsequently x->type->init_state.  It also gets rid
    of the unused args argument.
    
    Abstracting it out allows us to add common initialisation code, e.g.,
    to set family-specific flags.
    
    The add_time setting in xfrm_user.c was deleted because it's already
    set by xfrm_state_alloc.

    [PATCH] ARM: 2701/1: free up ixp2000 timer 4 for the watchdog
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    The IXP2000 has four timers, but if we're on an A-step IXP2800, timer
    2 and 3 don't work.  We need two timers for timekeeping (one for the
    timer interrupt and one for tracking missed jiffies), so on early
    IXP2800s we have no other choice but to use timer 1 and 4 for that,
    but on all other IXP2000s we'd rather leave timer 4 free since that's
    the only timer we can use for the watchdog.
    So, on buggy IXP2000s (i.e. the A-step IXP2800) we use timer 4 for
    tracking missed jiffies, and on all all non-buggy IXP2000s (i.e.
    everything but the A-step IXP2800) we use timer 2.
    On a pre-production IXP2800, this patch should print these messages
    on boot:
    	Enabling IXP2800 erratum #25 workaround
    	Unable to use IXP2000 watchdog due to IXP2800 erratum #25
    On any non-buggy IXP2800 (as well as on IXP2400s) you shouldn't see
    anything at all, and the watchdog should be usable again.

    [IPV4]: [4/4] signed vs unsigned cleanup in net/ipv4/raw.c
    
    This patch changes the type of the third parameter 'length' of the
    raw_send_hdrinc() function from 'int' to 'size_t'.
    This makes sense since this function is only ever called from one
    location, and the value passed as the third parameter in that location is
    itself of type size_t, so this makes the recieving functions parameter
    type match. Also, inside raw_send_hdrinc() the 'length' variable is
    used in comparisons with unsigned values and passed as parameter to
    functions expecting unsigned values (it's used in a single comparison with
    a signed value, but that one can never actually be negative so the patch
    also casts that one to size_t to stop gcc worrying, and it is passed in a
    single instance to memcpy_fromiovecend() which expects a signed int, but
    as far as I can see that's not a problem since the value of 'length'
    shouldn't ever exceed the value of a signed int).

    [IPV4]: [3/4] signed vs unsigned cleanup in net/ipv4/raw.c
    
    This patch changes the type of the local variable 'i' in
    raw_probe_proto_opt() from 'int' to 'unsigned int'. The only use of 'i' in
    this function is as a counter in a for() loop and subsequent index into
    the msg->msg_iov[] array.
    Since 'i' is compared in a loop to the unsigned variable msg->msg_iovlen
    gcc -W generates this warning :
    
    net/ipv4/raw.c:340: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
    
    Changing 'i' to unsigned silences this warning and is safe since the array
    index can never be negative anyway, so unsigned int is the logical type to
    use for 'i' and also enables a larger msg_iov[] array (but I don't know if
    that will ever matter).

    It doesn't change the behaviour of the code, simply writes the conditional
    expression with plain 'if()' syntax instead of '? :' , but since this
    breaks it into sepperate statements gcc no longer complains about having
    both a signed and unsigned value in the same conditional expression.

    [PKT_SCHED]: Generic queue management interface for qdiscs using internal skb queues
    
    Implements an interface to be used by leaf qdiscs maintaining an internal
    skb queue. The interface maintains a backlog in bytes additionaly
    to the skb_queue_len() maintained by the queue itself. Relevant statistics
    get incremented automatically. Every function comes in two variants, one
    assuming Qdisc->q is used as queue and the second taking a sk_buff_head
    as argument. Be aware that, if you use multiple queues, you still have to
    maintain the Qdisc->q.qlen counter yourself.

    [SCTP]: Replace spin_lock_irqsave with spin_lock_bh
    
    This patch replaces the spin_lock_irqsave call on the receive queue
    lock in SCTP with spin_lock_bh.  Despite the proliferation of
    spin_lock_irqsave calls in this stack, it is only entered from the
    IPv4/IPv6 stack and user space.  That is, it is never entered from
    hardirq context.
    
    The call in question is only called from recvmsg which means that
    IRQs aren't disabled.  Therefore it is safe to replace it with
    spin_lock_bh.

    [NETLINK]: Neighbour table configuration and statistics via rtnetlink
    
    To retrieve the neighbour tables send RTM_GETNEIGHTBL with the
    NLM_F_DUMP flag set. Every neighbour table configuration is
    spread over multiple messages to avoid running into message
    size limits on systems with many interfaces. The first message
    in the sequence transports all not device specific data such as
    statistics, configuration, and the default parameter set.
    This message is followed by 0..n messages carrying device
    specific parameter sets.
    
    Although the ordering should be sufficient, NDTA_NAME can be
    used to identify sequences. The initial message can be identified
    by checking for NDTA_CONFIG. The device specific messages do
    not contain this TLV but have NDTPA_IFINDEX set to the
    corresponding interface index.
    
    To change neighbour table attributes, send RTM_SETNEIGHTBL
    with NDTA_NAME set. Changeable attribute include NDTA_THRESH[1-3],
    NDTA_GC_INTERVAL, and all TLVs in NDTA_PARMS unless marked
    otherwise. Device specific parameter sets can be changed by
    setting NDTPA_IFINDEX to the interface index of the corresponding
    device.

    [NET] Generalise TCP's struct open_request minisock infrastructure
    
    Kept this first changeset minimal, without changing existing names to
    ease peer review.
    
    Basicaly tcp_openreq_alloc now receives the or_calltable, that in turn
    has two new members:
    
    ->slab, that replaces tcp_openreq_cachep
    ->obj_size, to inform the size of the openreq descendant for
      a specific protocol
    
    The protocol specific fields in struct open_request were moved to a
    class hierarchy, with the things that are common to all connection
    oriented PF_INET protocols in struct inet_request_sock, the TCP ones
    in tcp_request_sock, that is an inet_request_sock, that is an
    open_request.
    
    I.e. this uses the same approach used for the struct sock class
    hierarchy, with sk_prot indicating if the protocol wants to use the
    open_request infrastructure by filling in sk_prot->rsk_prot with an
    or_calltable.
    
    Results? Performance is improved and TCP v4 now uses only 64 bytes per
    open request minisock, down from 96 without this patch :-)
    
    Next changeset will rename some of the structs, fields and functions
    mentioned above, struct or_calltable is way unclear, better name it
    struct request_sock_ops, s/struct open_request/struct request_sock/g,
    etc.

    This introduces a leak when xfrm_state_add()/xfrm_state_update()
    fail. We hold two references (one from xfrm_state_alloc(), one
    from xfrm_state_hold()), but only drop one. We need to take the
    reference because the reference from xfrm_state_alloc() can
    be dropped by __xfrm_state_delete(), so the fix is to drop both
    references on error. Same problem in xfrm_user.c.

    [IPSEC] Use XFRM_MSG_* instead of XFRM_SAP_*
    
    This patch removes XFRM_SAP_* and converts them over to XFRM_MSG_*.
    The netlink interface is meant to map directly onto the underlying
    xfrm subsystem.  Therefore rather than using a new independent
    representation for the events we can simply use the existing ones
    from xfrm_user.

    [IPSEC] Fix xfrm to pfkey SA state conversion
    
    This patch adjusts the SA state conversion in af_key such that
    XFRM_STATE_ERROR/XFRM_STATE_DEAD will be converted to SADB_STATE_DEAD
    instead of SADB_STATE_DYING.
    
    According to RFC 2367, SADB_STATE_DYING SAs can be turned into
    mature ones through updating their lifetime settings.  Since SAs
    which are in the states XFRM_STATE_ERROR/XFRM_STATE_DEAD cannot
    be resurrected, this value is unsuitable.

    [IPSEC] Kill spurious hard expire messages
    
    This patch ensures that the hard state/policy expire notifications are
    only sent when the state/policy is successfully removed from their
    respective tables.
    
    As it is, it's possible for a state/policy to both expire through
    reaching a hard limit, as well as being deleted by the user.
    
    Note that this behaviour isn't actually forbidden by RFC 2367.
    However, it is a quality of implementation issue.
    
    As an added bonus, the restructuring in this patch will help
    eventually in moving the expire notifications from softirq
    context into process context, thus improving their reliability.
    
    One important side-effect from this change is that SAs reaching
    their hard byte/packet limits are now deleted immediately, just
    like SAs that have reached their hard time limits.
    
    Previously they were announced immediately but only deleted after
    30 seconds.
    
    This is bad because it prevents the system from issuing an ACQUIRE
    command until the existing state was deleted by the user or expires
    after the time is up.
    
    In the scenario where the expire notification was lost this introduces
    a 30 second delay into the system for no good reason.

    [SCSI] zfcp: fix: reopen port only if link-test fails
    
    From: Maxim Shchetynin <maxim@de.ibm.com>
    
    Reopen a remote port only if the link-test fails. This avoids that a
    port is unnecessarily reopened.

    [SCSI] zfcp: fix: allow more time for adapter initialization
    
    From: Maxim Shchetynin <maxim@de.ibm.com>
    
    Extend the time for adapter initialization: In case of protocol
    status HOST_CONNECTION_INITIALIZING for the exchange config data
    command do a first retry in 1 second, then double the sleep time for
    each following retry until recovery exceeds 2 minutes. The old
    behaviour of allowing 6 retries with .5 seconds delay between retries
    was insufficient and qdio queues were shut down too erarly.

    [SCSI] sg: Command completion after remove oops
    
    A problem exists todayin the sg driver that if an SG_IO request is
    outstanding to a device when it is removed from the system. The
    system may oops if that command completes later in time.
    
    1. sg_remove gets called
    2. sg_remove calls sg_finish_req_req on all pending requests
       This removes the Sg_request's from the headrp list in the Sg_fd
    3. The sleeping SG_IO ioctl is woken. It does nothing and returns.
    4. The caller closes the fd, which invokes sg_release
    5. sg_release calls sg_remove_sfp. It finds no outstanding commands
       since the headrp list is empty, so it calls __sg_remove_sfp,
       which frees the sfp.
    6. Now when sg_cmd_done gets called, sg uses upper_private_data in
       the Scsi_Request, which should point to the srp, which has been
       freed, so it points to freed memory.
    7. sg then dereferences the srp pointer to get the sfp, and we oops.
    
    The fix is to NULL out the upper_private_data field in this path,
    which sg_cmd_done already checks for, which will prevent the oops
    from occurring.

    Input: do not corrupt system-wide procfs fops.
    
    entry->proc_fops is a pointer to struct file_operations. When we
    call create_proc_entry(...), it pointis to proc_file_operations,
    deep in fs/proc/generic.c. By adding a 'poll' member to this struct
    we effectively force the 'poll' member on every file in /proc,
    which is wrong (they all fail select(...) calls).
    
    This patch changes a copy of entry->proc_fops and reassigns it rather
    than changing the original member.

    [ALSA] Reverted last patch for SNDCTL_DSP_GETOPTR fix & possible overflow fix
    
    ALSA<-OSS emulation
    This reverts the last patch which wrongly mixes bytes and frames.
    The real culprit might be the 32-bit overflow, so the return expression uses
    64-bit values now in snd_pcm_oss_bytes().

    USB generic driver
    When a USB packet boundary falls exactly on a buffer boundary, hwptr
    remains at the end of the buffer which causes an overflow in the next
    iteration and triggers double buffering although the next packet would
    actually be contiguous.
    
    This patch ensures that hwptr is always smaller than buffer_size.

    specification 1.0, the programming method is the same as that
    of intel HD Audio device exception one minor change which requires
    to enable snoop for DMA transport. There are 3 changes that have been

    Some HP OmniBook laptops (500 and 6000 at least) require some GPIO magic

    Something is still missing to make them work perfectly. However I have been

    USB generic driver,USB USX2Y
    Without this patch, some usb kobjects, which are parents to
    the usx2y's kobjects can be freed before the usx2y's.
    This led to an oops in get_kobj_path_length() and a dead
    keyboard, when the usx2y's kobjects were freed.
    The patch ensures the correct sequence.

    Add initial SigmaTel codec support for 9200 and 922x. Note that
    this hda patch relies on the configuration default registers to
    be set correctly (normally by BIOS/firmware) in order for it to
    set up pin widgets properly. There's a test switch in the patch
    so it will work with the SigmaTel reference boards that are usually
    plugged into a system that doesn't set the configuration default
    registers. It supports 2 channel analog out and line/mic in. I
    plan to add >2 channel support and spdif support shortly.

    AC97 Codec
    The handling of shared surround/clfe output jacks with line/mic-in
    on some AC97 codecs is improved.
    
    Instead of 'Line-In As Surround' or 'Mic As Center/LFE' switch, two
    new enum controls are introduced: 'Channel Mode' and 'Surround Jack Mode'.
    The formar changes the current output mode among 2, 4 and 6-channels.
    The latter controls whether the jacks are shared or independent.

    [ALSA] choose multi-channel jacks automatically
    
    HDA Codec driver
    Patch by C.L. Tien <cltien@cmedia.com.tw>:
    
    The patch makes cm9880 to choose multi-channel jacks automatically.
    
    1. I found the current code has basic_init, which already includes
       necessary controls for 6-stack initialization, so I don't need
       another model.
    
    2. I add a new model 'auto' to let the driver find a. if there are
       option real panel/front panel, b. the jacks to be used for multichannel.
    
    Because the jack color are based on MS's channel sequence, so the 'auto'
    model will pick the same jacks for multichannel MS uses. I did this to
    hope to minimize users questions. These code can also be applied to other
    codecs but I don't have any to test.

    [SCSI] TYPE_RBC cache fixes (sbp2.c affected)
    
    	a) TYPE_SDAD renamed to TYPE_RBC and taken to scsi.h
    	b) in sbp2.c remapping of TYPE_RPB to TYPE_DISK turned off
    	c) relevant places in midlayer and sd.c taught to accept TYPE_RBC
    	d) sd.c::sd_read_cache_type() looks into page 6 when dealing with
    TYPE_RBC - these guys have writeback cache flag there and are not guaranteed
    to have page 8 at all.
    	e) sd_read_cache_type() got an extra sanity check - it checks that
    it got the page it asked for before using its contents.  And screams if
    mismatch had happened.  Rationale: there are broken devices out there that
    are "helpful" enough to go for "I don't have a page you've asked for, here,
    have another one".  For example, PL3507 had been caught doing just that...
    	f) sbp2 sets sdev->use_10_for_rw and sdev->use_10_for_ms instead
    of bothering to remap READ6/WRITE6/MOD_SENSE, so most of the conversions
    in there are gone now.
    
    	Incidentally, I wonder if USB storage devices that have no
    mode page 8 are simply RBC ones.  I haven't touched that, but it might
    be interesting to check...

    [PATCH] sata_svw: Add support for new device IDs
    
    BCM5785 (HT1000) is a new southbridge from Serverworks/Broadcom that
    incorporates 4 SATA ports in a single PCIX function. Functionally these
    ports are similar to that in older devices like the Apple K2 and the
    Frodo4/8. This patch adds support for the new PCI device ID along with a
    blurb on what the various device IDs mean. Additionally in all devices
    based on this SATA controller, the SATA ports appear as a single PCI
    function. This is true for older Frodo8 devices as well. Hence the init
    function should init all the ports present in the detected controller
    (which could be 4 or 8).

    AUDIT: Fix remaining cases of direct logging of untrusted strings by avc_audit
    
    Per Steve Grubb's observation that there are some remaining cases where
    avc_audit() directly logs untrusted strings without escaping them, here
    is a patch that changes avc_audit() to use audit_log_untrustedstring()
    or audit_log_hex() as appropriate.  Note that d_name.name is nul-
    terminated by d_alloc(), and that sun_path is nul-terminated by
    unix_mkname(), so it is not necessary for the AVC to create nul-
    terminated copies or to alter audit_log_untrustedstring to take a length
    argument.  In the case of an abstract name, we use audit_log_hex() with
    an explicit length.

    [MTD] CFI flash locking reorg for XIP
    
    This reworks the XIP locking to make sure no lock primitive is ever
    called from XIP disabled paths even if in theory they should not
    cause any reschedule.  Relying on the current spinlock implementation
    is rather fragile and not especially clean from an abstraction pov.
    The recent RT work makes it even more obvious.

    [MTD] Fixup probing logic for single 16bit devices
    
    The change to the generic probe to look for the
    smallest width of chip first is causing some problems
    on boards with a single 16bit device.
    
    The problem seems to be the jedec_match() is truncating
    the device-id read from the table to match against the
    one read from the hardware, causing a match against the
    partial id of some chips with 16bit IDs (such as the
    SST39LF160)
    
    This fixes things for my own board, but something may
    need to be done if the same problem is exhibited for
    chips with an 8bit ID

    [JFFS2] Use a single config option for write buffer support
    
    This patch replaces the current CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_NAND, CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_NOR_ECC
    and CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_DATAFLASH with a single configuration option -
    CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_WRITEBUFFER.
    
    The only functional change of this patch is that the slower div/mod
    calculations for SECTOR_ADDR(), PAGE_DIV() and PAGE_MOD() are now always
    used when CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_WRITEBUFFER is enabled.

    For Dataflash, can_mark_obsolete = false and the NAND write buffering
    code (wbuf.c) is used.
    
    Since the DataFlash chip will automatically erase pages when writing,
    the cleanmarkers are not needed - so cleanmarker_oob = false and
    cleanmarker_size = 0
    
    DataFlash page-sizes are not a power of two (they're multiples of 528
    bytes).  The SECTOR_ADDR macro (added in the previous core patch) is
    replaced with a (slower) div/mod version if CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_DATAFLASH is

    [JFFS2] Core changes required to support JFFS2-on-Dataflash devices.
    
    DataFlash page-sizes are not a power of two (they're multiples of 528
    bytes).  There are a few places in JFFS2 code where sector_size is used
    as a bitmask.  A new macro (SECTOR_ADDR) was defined to calculate these
    sector addresses. For non-DataFlash devices, the original (faster)
    bitmask operation is still used.
    
    In scan.c, the EMPTY_SCAN_SIZE was a constant of 1024.
    Since this could be larger than the sector size of the DataFlash, this
    is now basically set to MIN(sector_size, 1024).
    
    Addition of a jffs2_is_writebuffered() macro.

    [SCSI] 2.6 aacraid: Variable FIB size (updated patch)
    
    New code from the Adaptec driver.  Performance enhancement for newer
    adapters.  I hope that this isn't too big for a single patch.  I believe
    that other than the few small cleanups mentioned, that the changes are
    all related.
    
    - Added Variable FIB size negotiation for new adapters.
    - Added support to maximize scatter gather tables and thus permit
      requests larger than 64KB/each.
    - Limit Scatter Gather to 34 elements for ROMB platforms.
    - aac_printf is only enabled with AAC_QUIRK_34SG
    - Large FIB ioctl support
    - some minor cleanup
    
    Passes sparse check.
    I have tested it on x86 and ppc64 machines.

    [SCSI] remove a timer race in scsi_queue_insert()
    
    scsi_queue_insert() has four callers.  Three callers call with
    timer disabled and one (the second invocation in
    scsi_dispatch_cmd()) calls with timer activated.
    scsi_queue_insert() used to always call scsi_delete_timer()
    and ignore the return value.  This results in race with timer
    expiration.  Remove scsi_delete_timer() call from
    scsi_queue_insert() and make the caller delete timer and check

    [SCSI] ipr: Fix ipr PCI hotplug hang with CDROM attach
    
    Currently, during PCI hotplug remove, if the upper layer
    drivers of the attached devices send commands down as part
    of the remove action, like a CDROM, the hotplug action
    will hang forever due to the ipr driver returning
    SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY. Patch fixes this.

    This patch addresses the sparse -Wbitwise warnings that Christoph wanted
    me to eliminate.  This mostly consisted of making data structure
    elements of hardware associated structures the __le* equivalent.
    Although there were a couple places where there was mixing of cpu and le
    variable math.  These changes have been tested on both an x86 and ppc
    machine running bonnie++.  The usage of the LE32_ALL_ONES macro has been
    eliminated.

    [SCSI] make scsi_queue_insert() use blk_requeue_request()
    
    scsi_queue_insert() used to use blk_insert_request() for requeueing
    requests.  This depends on the unobvious behavior of
    blk_insert_request() setting REQ_SPECIAL and REQ_SOFTBARRIER when
    requeueing.  This patch makes scsi_queue_insert() use
    blk_requeue_request().  As REQ_SPECIAL means special requests and
    REQ_SOFTBARRIER is automatically handled by blk layer now, no flag
    needs to be set.
    
    Note that scsi_queue_insert() now calls scsi_run_queue() itself, and
    the prototype of the function is added right above
    scsi_queue_insert().  This is temporary, as later requeue path
    consolidation patchset removes scsi_queue_insert().  By adding
    temporary prototype, we can do away with unnecessarily moving
    functions.

    Restore logging of pid= and comm= in AVC audit messages
    
    We turned this all off because the 'exe=' was causing deadlocks on
    dcache_lock. There's no need to leave the pid and comm out though.
    They'll all be logged correctly if full auditing is enabled, but we
    should still print them in case auditing _isn't_ enabled.

    AUDIT: Clean up logging of untrusted strings
    
    * If vsnprintf returns -1, it will mess up the sk buffer space accounting.
    This is fixed by not calling skb_put with bogus len values.
    
    * audit_log_hex was a loop that called audit_log_vformat with %02X for each
    character. This is very inefficient since conversion from unsigned character
    to Ascii representation is essentially masking, shifting, and byte lookups.
    Also, the length of the converted string is well known - it's twice the
    original. Fixed by rewriting the function.
    
    * audit_log_untrustedstring had no comments. This makes it hard for
    someone to understand what the string format will be.
    
    * audit_log_d_path was never fixed to use untrustedstring. This could mess
    up user space parsers. This was fixed to make a temp buffer, call d_path,
    and log temp buffer using untrustedstring.

      [PATCH] Wireless Extensions 18 (aka WPA)
    
            This is version 18 of the Wireless Extensions. The main change
      is that it adds all the necessary APIs for WPA and WPA2 support. This
      work was entirely done by Jouni Malinen, so let's thank him for both
      his hard work and deep expertise on the subject ;-)
            This APIs obviously doesn't do much by itself and works in
      concert with driver support (Jouni already sent you the HostAP
      changes) and userspace (Jouni is updating wpa_supplicant). This is
      also orthogonal with the ongoing work on in-kernel IEEE support (but
      potentially useful).
            The patch is attached, tested with 2.6.11. Normally, I would
      ask you to push that directly in the kernel (99% of the patch has been
      on my web page for ages and it does not affect non-WPA stuff), but
      Jouni convinced me that it should bake a few weeks in wireless-2.6
      first, so that other driver maintainers can get up to speed with it.

      Adds an ignore_disconnect module parameter.  When enabled, the driver
      will continue attempting to send packets even when the firmware has
      told us we've lost our link to the AP.  On some firmwares this
      substantially increases the usable range of the card (presumably
      because we have an interrmittent connection, but the firmware is able
      to queue the packets for us until we're connected again).  On some
      other cards, it causes the firmware to fall in a screaming heap :(
      (hence, default off).

      [PATCH] PPP multilink fragmentation improvements
    
      Here's a patch for -mm for now.  Not sure whose territory this falls
      in, so I'm sending it to everyone I can think of. :)
    
      Some time ago I did some experiments with using PPP multilink over
      largish numbers of channels (up to 32).  The TCP performance was
      woeful due to wildly fluctuating packet latencies, which turned out to
      be because we would sometimes split a packet across all 32 channels,
      and sometimes we would send a whole packet down a single channel.
    
      This patch fixes those problems by being a bit cleverer about how the
      packets are split across the available channels, and in particular, it
      waits until at least half of the channels can take another fragment
      before starting to split up the next packet.
    
      The patch also fixes a buglet in the multilink reconstruction code
      where it would discard incoming packets that had just the multilink
      header and no data.  Such packets are valid and shouldn't be
      discarded.

      [PATCH] 8139too: use iomap for pio/mmio
    
      This patch converts the 8139too driver to use the iomap infrastructure
      for PIO and MMIO instead of playing macro tricks.  I also had to fix
      read_eeprom(), mdio_sync(), mdio_read(), and mdio_write() to not pass
      PIO base address to MMIO read() and write() functions.  In addition,
      the patch adds proper __iomem annotations for the driver.
    
      Both modes, PIO and MMIO, were tested with a RealTel RTL8139 card on
      an x86 box.  The 8129 support remains untested due to lack of
      hardware.

    The attached patch addresses the problem with getting the audit daemon
    shutdown credential information. It creates a new message type
    AUDIT_TERM_INFO, which is used by the audit daemon to query who issued the
    shutdown.
    
    It requires the placement of a hook function that gathers the information. The
    hook is after the DAC & MAC checks and before the function returns. Racing
    threads could overwrite the uid & pid - but they would have to be root and
    have policy that allows signalling the audit daemon. That should be a
    manageable risk.
    
    The userspace component will be released later in audit 0.7.2. When it
    receives the TERM signal, it queries the kernel for shutdown information.
    When it receives it, it writes the message and exits. The message looks
    like this:
    
    type=DAEMON msg=auditd(1114551182.000) auditd normal halt, sending pid=2650
    uid=525, auditd pid=1685

    [IA64] use srlz.d instead of srlz.i in ia64_leave_kernel()
    
    This patch switches the srlz.i in ia64_leave_kernel() to srlz.d.  As
    per architecture manual, the former is needed only to ensure that the
    clearing of PSR.IC is seen by the VHPT for subsequent instruction
    fetches.  However, since the remainder of the code (up to and
    including the RFI instruction) is mapped by a pinned TLB entry, there
    is no chance of an iTLB miss and we don't care whether or not the VHPT
    sees PSR.IC cleared.  Since srlz.d is substantially cheaper than
    srlz.i, this should shave off a few cycles off the interrupt path
    (unverified though; I'm not setup to measure this at the moment).

    [IA64] Reschedule fsys_bubble_down().
    
    Improvements come from eliminating srlz.i, not scheduling AR/CR-reads
    too early (while there are others still pending), scheduling the
    backing-store switch as well as possible, splitting the BBB bundle
    into a MIB/MBB pair.
    
    Why is it safe to eliminate the srlz.i?  Observe
    that we used to clear bits ~PSR_PRESERVED_BITS in PSR.L.  Since
    PSR_PRESERVED_BITS==PSR.{UP,MFL,MFH,PK,DT,PP,SP,RT,IC}, we
    ended up clearing PSR.{BE,AC,I,DFL,DFH,DI,DB,SI,TB}.  However,
    
     PSR.BE : already is turned off in __kernel_syscall_via_epc()
     PSR.AC : don't care (kernel normally turns PSR.AC on)
     PSR.I  : already turned off by the time fsys_bubble_down gets invoked
     PSR.DFL: always 0 (kernel never turns it on)
     PSR.DFH: don't care --- kernel never touches f32-f127 on its own
    	  initiative
     PSR.DI : always 0 (kernel never turns it on)
     PSR.SI : always 0 (kernel never turns it on)
     PSR.DB : don't care --- kernel never enables kernel-level breakpoints
     PSR.TB : must be 0 already; if it wasn't zero on entry to
    	  __kernel_syscall_via_epc, the branch to fsys_bubble_down
    	  will trigger a taken branch; the taken-trap-handler then
    	  converts the syscall into a break-based system-call.
    
    In other words: all the bits we're clearying are either 0 already or
    are don't cares!  Thus, we don't have to write PSR.L at all and we
    don't have to do a srlz.i either.
    
    Good for another ~20 cycle improvement for EPC-based heavy-weight
    syscalls.

    [IA64] Reschedule __kernel_syscall_via_epc().
    
    Avoid some stalls, which is good for about 2 cycles when invoking a
    light-weight handler.  When invoking a heavy-weight handler, this
    helps by about 7 cycles, with most of the improvement coming from the
    improved branch-prediction achieved by splitting the BBB bundle into
    two MIB bundles.

    [IA64] Reschedule break_fault() for better performance.
    
    This patch reorganizes break_fault() to optimistically assume that a
    system-call is being performed from user-space (which is almost always
    the case).  If it turns out that (a) we're not being called due to a
    system call or (b) we're being called from within the kernel, we fixup
    the no-longer-valid assumptions in non_syscall() and .break_fixup(),
    respectively.
    
    With this approach, there are 3 major phases:
    
     - Phase 1: Read various control & application registers, in
    	    particular the current task pointer from AR.K6.
     - Phase 2: Do all memory loads (load system-call entry,
    	    load current_thread_info()->flags, prefetch
    	    kernel register-backing store) and switch
    	    to kernel register-stack.
     - Phase 3: Call ia64_syscall_setup() and invoke
    	    syscall-handler.
    
    Good for 26-30 cycles of improvement on break-based syscall-path.

    Reschedule code to read ar.bsp as early as possible.  To enable this,
    don't bother clearing some of the registers when we're returning to
    kernel stacks.  Also, instead of trying to support the pNonSys case
    (which makes no sense), do a bugcheck instead (with break 0).  Finally,
    remove a clear of r14 which is a left-over from the previous patch.

    [IA64] In syscall-entry, use st8 instead of stf8 to clear pt_regs.r8
    
    Using stf8 seemed like a clever idea at the time, but stf8 forces
    the cache-line to be invalidated in the L1D (if it happens to be
    there already).  This patch eliminates a guaranteed L1D cache-miss
    and, by itself, is good for a 1-2 cycle improvement for heavy-weight
    syscalls.

    [IA64] On return from syscall, hint b7 with __kernel_syscall_via_epc().
    
    Why is this a good idea?  Clearing b7 to 0 is guaranteed to do us no
    good and writing it with __kernel_syscall_via_epc() yields a 6 cycle
    improvement _if_ the application performs another EPC-based system-
    call without overwriting b7, which is not all that uncommon.  Well
    worth the minimal cost of 1 bundle of code.
