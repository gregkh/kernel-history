    	if (mstat & UART_MSR_DSR)
    		result |= TIOCM_DSR;
        and ended with return result; since TIOCM_DSR is 256 on e.g.  i386,

    [PATCH] ext3: dynamic allocation of block reservation info
    
    Right now the ext3 reservation structure(ext3_reserve_window_node) is part of
    the ext3 inode itself.  This part of information is only needed for files that
    need allocate blocks on disk.  So, the attached patches reduce the ext3 inode
    size by dynamically allocating the block allocation/reservation info
    structure(called struct ext3_block_alloc_info) when it is needed(i.e.  only
    for files who need to allocate blocks)
    
    The reservation structure is being allocated and linked to the ext3 inode at
      ext3_get_block_handle(), and being freed and unlinked at the
    iput_final->ext3_clear_inode().
    
    The ei->truncate_sem which is currently used to protect concurrent
    ext3_get_block() and ext3_truncate is used to protect reservation structure
    allocation and deallocation.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix boot memory corruption
    
    Nathan's patch "make OF node fixup code usable at runtim" is introducing a
    snaky bug.  We do 2 passes over this code, one to measure how much memory
    will be needed so we can allocate a single block, and one to do the actual
    fixup.  However, the new code does some result-checking of prom_alloc()
    which breaks this mecanism, as the first pass always starts at "0", thus we
    fail to measure the additional size properly and allocate a block smaller
    than what we'll actually use for the fixup.  This cause us to override
    whatever sits there, with variable results depending on the memory layout
    of the machine (but typically crashes).
    
    This patch fixes it by starting the "measure" pass with an initial size set
    to 16 and not 0.

    [PATCH] ppc32: clean up arch/ppc/syslib/prom_init.c
    
    The call_prom routine in arch/ppc/syslib/prom_init.c, which does a client
    call to Open Firmware, returns a void *, and we use void * for instance
    handles and package handles that are returned from and used in OF calls.
    This is a bad idea - we can't ever dereference those things, and we end up
    with a lot of casts because arguments to and return values from OF calls
    are sometimes handles and sometimes numbers.
    
    This patch cleans things up by using u32 as the type for OF handles.  The
    return type of call_prom becomes int because the return value from an OF
    call is often an int status code.  The number of casts in prom_init.c is
    reduced substantially by this patch.

    Private mappings will now be backed by the underlying device directly if
    possible, where "possible" is constrained by the protection mask parameter
    and the device capabilities mask.
    
    I've also split the do_mmap_pgoff() function contents into a number of
    auxilliary functions to make it easier to understand.
    
    The documentation is also updated; including the addition of a warning

    	* all instances of soc_cq were either always of request or always of
    response variety; replaced with soc_cq_rsp and soc_cq_req resp.
    	* the rest consists of trivial adding __iomem where needed - the
    only tricky bit had been soc_cq annotations.

    [NET]: Missing proto_list_lock initialization.
    
    The new protocol registration locking uses a rwlock to limit access
    to the protocol list.  Unfortunately, the initialisation:
    
    static rwlock_t proto_list_lock;
    
    Only works to initialise the lock as unlocked on platforms whose unlock
    signal is all zeros.  On other platforms, they think it's already locked
    and hang forever.

    [SELINUX]: Fix for removal of i_sock
    
    This patch against -bk eliminates the use of i_sock by SELinux as it
    appears to have been removed recently, breaking the build of SELinux in
    -bk.  Simply replacing the i_sock test with an S_ISSOCK test would be
    unsafe in the SELinux code, as the latter will also return true for the
    inodes of socket files in the filesystem, not just the actual socket
    objects IIUC.  Hence this patch reworks the SELinux code to avoid the
    need to apply such a test in the first place, part of which was
    obsoleted anyway by earlier changes to SELinux.  Please apply.

    [PATCH] I2C: Fix a common race condition in hardware monitoring
    
    Grant Coady noticed that most hardware monitoring drivers are exposed to
    a race condition when one writes to the sysfs files they create. While
    the read calls properly request a lock on the internal data, write calls
    manipulate the internal data without proper locking. This big patch
    fixes that by adding locking wherever needed.
    
    Affected drivers: adm1021, adm1025, asb100, ds1621, fscher, fscpos,
    gl518sm, gl520sm, it87, lm63, lm75, lm77, lm78, lm80, lm83, lm87, lm90,
    lm92, max1619, pc87360, pcf8591, sis5595, smsc47m1, via686a, w83627hf
    and w83781d
    
    The adm1026, adm1031 and lm85 were already locking on write calls, but
    held the lock for code that did not require it, so they have been
    modified too.
    
    The smsc47b397 and w83l785ts drivers were not affected, because they are
    read-only.
    
    The patch should apply just fine on top of your stack, provided that you
    applied all previous patches in order (in particular, there is one lm87
    indentation patch which is needed).

    [PATCH] I2C: Move functionality handling from i2c-core to i2c.h
    
    So far, the functionality handling of i2c adapters was done in i2c-core
    by two exported functions: i2c_get_functionality and
    i2c_check_functionality. I found that both functions could be reduced to
    one line each, and propose that we turn them into inline function in the
    i2c.h header file, much like other i2c helper functions (e.g.
    i2c_get_clientdata, i2c_set_clientdata and i2c_clientname).
    
    The conversion of i2c_get_functionality suppresses a legacy check which
    shouldn't be needed anymore. Only one driver (s3c2410) was still relying
    on it, and was fixed some days ago.
    
    The conversion lets us get rid of two exports. Not only i2c-core gets
    smaller (by 458 bytes), but the client drivers using these functions get
    smaller too (typically by 48 bytes). And of course the new way is likely
    to be faster too, even if it wasn't my primary objective.

    [PATCH] I2C: pcf8574 doesn't need a lock
    
    While investigating the i2c chips drivers that were not properly
    locking, we found that the pcf8574 driver does the exact contrary. It
    uses a lock where it's not needed.
    
    While we were there, we did some additional cleanups to the driver:
    1* Merge pcf8574_update_client() in show_read(), as it was the only user
    and the function became trivial once the locking was removed.
    2* Add a validity check on values provided by user-space.
    
    Aurelien Jarno tested the modified code for confirmation and it worked
    just fine.

    [IPSEC]: Make IPCOMP more resilient.
    
    Since the IPCOMP header is left off when the payload is incompressible
    or too small, we can also do the same thing when we encounter an error
    during compression.
    
    In other words, we can let outbound IPCOMP always succeed.  In the cases
    where it would currently fail we simply skip the IPCOMP transform.  This
    makes IPCOMP slightly more resilient when memory is low and simplifies
    the code quite a bit.

    [IPSEC]: Move xfrm_flush_bundles into xfrm_state GC
    
    Fixes ABBA deadlock noticed by Patrick McHardy.
    
    The locking in xfrm_state/xfrm_policy has always struck me as being
    an overkill.  A lot of the locks should be replaced by rules that
    ensure the validity of most operations while a ref count is held.
    Now I have an excuse to do just that :)
    
    For 2.6.12 let's go for a simpler fix that breaks the dead lock.
    
    __xfrm_state_delete does not need to flush the bundles immediately.
    In fact, it is more efficient if we delay the flush to the GC worker
    since the flush is not dependent on any particular xfrm state.  By
    delaying it we can do one single flush even when you're deleteing
    the entire xfrm state list.

    [NETLINK]: More complete fix for race.
    
    Unfortunately my patch only closed half the race.  There is still
    a chunk of code between netlink_dump_start and netlink_dump that runs
    outside the cb lock which isn't protected by an sk reference.
    
    Here is a better patch which protects the entire netlink_dump function
    with a sk reference.
    
    The other call to netlink_dump by recvmsg is safe as the open file
    descriptor already holds a reference.  As such the final sock_put
    in netlink_dump can be turned into a __sock_put since there is at
    least one reference held by the caller.

    [PATCH] I2C: Fix broken force parameter handling
    
    I just noticed a nasty bug in the way the "force" parameter is handled
    for non-sensors i2c chip drivers. The "force" parameter supposedy is a
    list of adapter, address *pairs* where supported chips are
    unquestionably assumed to be. However, after handling one pair, the i2c
    core code searches for the next one *three* values later, not two. So
    with the current code, the second and third pairs wouldn't be properly
    handled. The fourth one would be, and so on.
    
    As a side note, this questions the need of an array parameter handling
    up to 24 of such pairs, when obviously nobody ever required more than
    one for the past 6 years.

    * Change the dev_err() call on no-ack to an dev_dbg() to make

    * Add I2C_M_REV_DIR_ADDR to fully implement the

    * Ensure that the adapter owner field is set to THIS_MODULE

    [PATCH] I2C: Fix race condition in it87 driver
    
    I noticed a race condition in the it87, affecting the IT8712F chip only.
    The VRM value is currently initialized *after* creating the vrm and vid
    sysfs files. This leaves a theorical room for reading from these files
    and get an invalid value. It's not critical, but let's still fix it.

    [PATCH] I2C: Delete useless instruction in it87
    
    The IT8705F doesn't support VID, so it's quite pointless to give a value
    to it (and an arbitrary one at that). I think that this instruction was
    there for compatibility reasons some times ago, but the reasons went
    away while the instruction was left in place. We can safely delete it
    now.
    
    Thanks to Rudolf Marek for testing the patch (you never know).

    [PATCH] I2C: lsb in emc6d102 and adm1027
    
    The attached patches add support for reading the lsb from the emc6d102
    and change how they are read from the adm1027.
    
    The lm85_update_device function decodes the LSBs to temp_ext and in_ext.
    This strategy was suggested by Philip Pokorny.
    
    The patch also changes some macros to use the SCALE macro. I think that
    they become more readable this way.

    [PATCH] I2C: lost arbitration detection for PCF8584
    
    [PATCH] lost arbitration detection for PCF8584 algo driver
    
    Patch against a slightly-dated linux-2.6 BK tree
    
    This patch provides lost arbitration detection for the PCF8584
    I2C algorithm driver.  The PCF8584 LAB bit is set whenever lost
    arbitration is detected, so we check the bit in the wait_for_pin
    function and if LAB is detected we return -EINTR.  The -EINTR
    value bubbles-up all the way to the master_xfer API call so
    callers may detect this condition explicitly.  LAB could be checked
    more often, at the expense of code readability/maintainability.

    [PATCH] I2C: Avoid repeated resets of i2c-viapro
    
    It was reported that the i2c-viapro SMBus driver sometimes has trouble
    on recent systems (VT8237 south bridge). The "Host Status" register has
    at least one additional bit used when compared with older south bridges
    of this family. The driver currently considers this additional bit as an
    error condition when it's set, causing repeated bus resets and sometimes
    read failures.
    
    This patch makes the driver ignore the bits of the "Host Status"
    register for which no definition is known. I wish I had a datasheet for
    the VIA VT8237, so that I could check what the additional bit is
    supposed to mean, but I don't. If someone has a datasheet or good
    contacts at VIA, please let me know.
    
    The patch was reported to fix the problem on a system with the VT8237,
    and was also tested not to break the driver on older VIA south bridges,
    so it seems to be safe. Thanks to Aurelien Jarno for the tests.
    
    Additionally, the patch makes the post-transaction bus reset slightly
    more efficient by sparing a few unneeded I/O operations.

    [PATCH] I2C: Kill outdated defines in i2c.h
    
    Some defines in i2c.h (I2C_CLIENT_MODPARM and friends) are now useless.
    They should have been removed when the i2c client parameters were
    converted from MODULE_PARAM to module_parm_array, but where not. This
    patch removes them now.
    
    Additionally, it moves the definition of I2C_CLIENT_MAX_OPTS next to
    where it is used rather than 220 lines before, which is preferable IMHO.
    
    As a side note, I think that there is a bug in the way these options are
    handled. The i2c code looks for I2C_CLIENT_END as a list terminator, but
    if the maximum number of parameters are actually provided, no terminator
    will be left. It's rather unlikely to happen because nobody will
    probably ever provide that many parameters, but this should probably be
    fixed. I'll address this issue later, since I plan to completely rewrite
    the way these parameters are handled anyway.

    Also, since the adt7461 treats temp values <0 as 0 and >127 as 127,
    the driver prevents temperature values outside the supported range

    [PATCH] I2C: Skip broken detection step in it87
    
    One of the detection steps in the it87 chip driver was reported to be
    broken for some revisions of the IT8712F chip [1] [2]. This detection
    step is a legacy from the lm78 driver and the documentation available
    for the IT8705F and IT8712F chips does not mention it at all. For this
    reason, I propose to skip this detection step for Super-I/O chips.
    Super-I/O chips have already been identified when we reach this step, so
    it is redundant (additionally do being broken). This closes bug #4335.

    This is a new i2c chip driver named lm92. It supports the National

    that the original driver has a different structure from the other i2c
    chip drivers, which would have made maintenance harder.
    
    I don't have a compatible chip myself but could test my code thanks to

    [PATCH] nfsd4: rename release_delegation
    
    Release_delegation is responsible for removing the delegation's connection
    with the v4 state and with the lease subsystem.  The word "unhash" seems
    closer than "release" as a description of this....

    [PATCH] nfsd4: acl error fix
    
    When a client sends an ACL that is a legal NFSv4 ACL, but that we don't
    support (because we can't represent it using a POSIX ACL), the correct error
    to return is NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP.
    
    (rfc3530, section 5.11.1: "If the server recieves a request to set an ACE that
    it cannot store, it MUST reject the request with NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP.  If the
    server receives a request to set an ACE that it can store but cannot enforce,
    the server SHOULD reject the request with NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP").

    [PATCH] nfsd4: acl don't set named attrs
    
    We were expecting {read,write}_named_attributes to be set in sync with the
    read and write bits.  But we don't actually support named attributes, and when
    we eventually do, it's unlikely that we'll want to use these ACL mode bits to
    control access to them.  So let's just stop supporting these two bits.
    
    This also updates our mapping to the latest ietf draft.

    [PATCH] nfsd4: don't set WRITE_OWNER in either allow or deny bits
    
    WRITE_OWNER should be neither allowed nor denied.
    
    This improves interoperability with Solaris clients and represents our
    permissions more accurately.
    
    It breaks compatibility with clients using the old version of the
    NFSv4<->POSIX mapping.  I believe the only code that did that was older
    versions of experimental client-side code available only from our website, so
    I prefer not to introduce a hack just to continue support the old mapping.

    [PATCH] nfsd4_remove_unused_acl_function
    
    We're translating v4 ACL's to POSIX ACL's and relying on the filesystem to
    check those, so there's no need for a NFSv4 ACL-checking algorithm.
    
    Some day we'd like to find a way to implement the full v4 ACL protocol on the
    server side, but for now this is dead code.

    [PATCH] s1d13xxxfb: Add support for Epson S1D13806 FB
    
    Add support for Epson S1D13806 framebuffer device.
    
    The driver is intended to be easily used with other S1D13xxx devices,
    hopefully by splitting the header file and changing a few defines.  Since I
    haven't got the hardware to test that, though, I can only assert that it
    works with S1D13806.
    
    This driver has been succesfully tested on ARM embedded boards and reported
    working on SH architecture as well.
    
    Since this is my first framebuffer driver, I would welcome any
    suggestion/comment about it :)
    
    This driver has been built on top of some preliminary ARM specific work by
    Ben Dooks, and adapted from existing code (as stated in the header of
    s1d13xxxfb.c).

    [PATCH] nvidiafb: Maximize blit buffer capacity
    
    Currently, nvidiafb blit expands a rectangle a scanline at a time.  This is
    very inefficient because the graphics pipeline is not maximized.  It may also
    crash if the scanline is > 4096 (should not happen with fbcon though).
    
    Instead of blitting a scanline at a time, attempt to fill up buffer to maximum
    capacity.

    [PATCH] fbcon: Stop framebuffer operations before hardware is properly initialized
    
    Accessing the hardware before it is properly initialized can lead to crashes
    or screen corruption.  This happens when switching to X then back to console.
    When console comes back from X, the device is in an undefined state.  During
    this window, accessing the hardware is disallowed.
    
    A new field in fbcon_par is added (graphics), which will be set to nonzero
    just before initialization of the framebuffer and when coming back from
    KD_GRAPHICS, then unset when an fb_set_var/fb_set_par is done.  While this
    field is set, no accesses to the hardware is done.  The consequence of this
    change is, hopefully, more robust switching between KD_GRAPHICS<-> KD_TEXT.
    
    An added benefit coming from this change is that the MODESWITCHLATE hack is
    not needed anymore and thus removed.  This hack is used by savagefb, rivafb
    and nvidiafb.

    unblank at interrupt time (unless oops_in_progress is set, in which case I use

    It also removes obsolete code that used to disable some power management

    [PATCH] vt: don't call unblank at irq time
    
    This patch removes the call to unblank() from printk, and avoids calling
    unblank at irq() time _unless_ oops_in_progress is 1.  I also export
    oops_in_progress() so drivers who care like radeonfb can test it and know
    what to do.  I audited call sites of unblank_screen(), console_unblank(),
    etc...  and I _hope_ I got them all, the patch includes a small patch to
    the s390 bust_spinlocks code that sets oops_in_progress back to 0 _after_
    unblanking for example.
    
    I added a few might_sleep() to help us catch possible remaining callers.
    
    I'll soon write a document explaining fbdev locking.  The current situation
    after this patch is that:
    
    - All callbacks have console_semaphore held (fbdev's are fully
      serialised).
    
    - Everything is called in schedule'able context, except the cfb_*
      rendering operations and cursor operations, with the special case of
      unblank who can be called at any time when "oops_in_progress" is true.  A
      driver that needs to sleep in it's unblank implementation is welcome to
      test that variable and use a fallback path (or just do nothing if it's
      not simple).

    [PATCH] Kprobes: Allow/deny probes on int3/breakpoint instruction?
    
    Kprobes did an improper exit when a probe is inserted on an int3
    instruction.  In case of normal execution of int3/breakpoint instruction,
    it oops!.  Probe on an int3 instruction was not handled properly by the
    kprobes, it generated faults after oops!  doing an improper exit with
    holding the lock.  This fix employes a bit different method to handle probe
    on an int3/breakpoint instruction.
    
    On execution of an int3/breakpoint instruction (placed by kprobe),
    kprobes_handler() is called which sets it for single stepping in-line(it
    does not matter whether we single step out-of-line/inline since the single
    stepping instruction is same).  Now it single steps on int3/breakpoint
    instruction here, entering kprobes_handler() once again.  Kprobes now
    check's the status that it is single stepping and avoids the recursion.  It
    runs down through the trap handler and oops messages is seen on the console
    since it executed int3/breakpoint instruction.  Here the kprobes single
    stepping handler never gets called.
    
    Is this behaviour acceptable ?  Or should we avoid putting probes on an
    int3 /breakpoint instruction ?  How should it handle such situations?
    Below is the patch to allow probes on an int3/breakpoint instruction.
    
    This patch fixes the above problem by doing a proper exit while avoiding
    recursion.

    The kprobe_handler() code currently does not check if a pre_handler is

    [PATCH] uml: Fix the console stuttering
    
    I spent far too much of the weekend tracking this sucker down through the guts

    write_chan that does buffering and retransmitting data, and
    arch/um/drivers/chan_kern.c ALSO has a write_chan that buffers and retransmits
    data, and the first calls the second but the second doesn't always return
    correct status information for the -EAGAIN case.
    
    When they get confused, both of them try to buffer and retransmit data, hence
    the stuttering.
    
    The first fix is that if chan_kern's write_chan gets an -EAGAIN, it should NOT
    gratuitously change that to a 0 before returning.  I don't know why that code
    is in there, but deleting those two lines makes 90% the stuttering go away.
    But not quite all of it.
    
    The second half of the fix is arch/um/drivers/line.c has a buffer_data()
    function that adds data to the buffer, tries to flush the buffer out to disk,
    gets -EAGAIN, and then returns -EAGAIN even though it successfully buffered
    all the data it was sent.  So the upper layer resubmits the last chunk of data
    it sent when the console unblocks, even though the lower layer buffered it and
    sent it on by that point.
    
    With this patch, I can't get the UML console to stutter anymore by suspending
    the process it's writing to.  (Add tee to the mix and you can still make it
    hang by suspending its xterm for a second or two, but I think that tee is
    hanging, not UML.  Hangs with RHEL4 tee, but not busybox tee...)

    [PATCH] uml: fix hostfs special perm handling
    
    When opening devices nodes on hostfs, it does not make sense to call access(),
    since we are not going to open the file on the host.
    
    If the device node is owned by root, the root user in UML should succeed in
    opening it, even if UML won't be able to open the file.
    
    As reported by Rob Landley, UML currently does not follow this, so here's a
    fix.

    [PATCH] uml: quick fix syscall table
    
    *) Uml 2.6.11 does not compile with gcc 2.95.4 because some entries are
    duplicated, and that GCC does not accept this (unlike gcc 3). Plus various
    other bugs in the syscall table definitions:
    
      *) 223 is a syscall hole (i.e. ni_syscall) only on i386, on x86_64 it's a
      valid syscall (thus a duplicated one).
    
      *) __NR_vserver must be only once with sys_ni_syscall, and not multiple
      times with different values!
    
      *) syscalls duplicated in SUBARCHs and in common files (thus assigning twice
      to the same array entry and causing the GCC 2.95.4 failure mentioned above):
      sys_utimes, which is common, and sys_fadvise64_64, sys_statfs64,
      sys_fstatfs64, which exist only on i386.
    
      *) syscalls duplicated in each SUBARCH, to put in common files:
      sys_remap_file_pages, sys_utimes, sys_fadvise64
    
      *) 285 is a syscall hole (i.e. ni_syscall) only on i386, on x86_64 the range
      does not arrive to that point.
    
      *) on x86_64, the macro name is __NR_kexec_load and not __NR_sys_kexec_load.
      Use the correct name in either case.
    
    Note: as you can see, part of the syscall table definition in UML is
    arch-independent (with everywhere defined syscalls), and part is
    arch-dependant. This has created confusion (some syscalls are listed in both
    places, some in the wrong one, some are wrong on one arch or another).
    
    Also, as add-ons:
    
    *) uses __va_copy instead of va_copy since some old versions of gcc (2.95.4
    for instance) don't accept va_copy.
    
    *) some whitespace cleanups in the syscall table (if you don't like them, feel
    free to remove them).

    [PATCH] uml: fix sigio spinlock
    
    I just saw a "take twice spinlock" deadlock with the Spinlock debugging
    enabled on this lock, and static code analysis revealed this is the culprit:
    update_thread can take (in an error path) the sigio_lock, which is already
    held by all its callers (it's a static function, so it's easy to verify).
    
    Added some comments to mark where this function needs the lock, in case
    someone wants to reduce the locking here.
    
    Also clean an exitcall to mark the thread as killed (won't hurt, and could be
    useful if things go wrong).
    
    As a bonus, some CodingStyle cleanups.

    [PATCH] x86, x86_64: reading deterministic cache parameters and exporting it in /sysfs
    
    The attached patch adds support for using cpuid(4) instead of cpuid(2), to
    get CPU cache information in a deterministic way for Intel CPUs, whenever
    supported.  The details of cpuid(4) can be found here
    
    IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual (vol 2a)
    (http://developer.intel.com/design/pentium4/manuals/index_new.htm#sdm_vol2a)
    and
    Prescott New Instructions (PNI) Technology: Software Developer's Guide
    (http://www.intel.com/cd/ids/developer/asmo-na/eng/events/43988.htm)
    
    The advantage of using the cpuid(4) ('Deterministic Cache Parameters Leaf') are:
    
    - It provides more information than the descriptors provided by cpuid(2)
    
    - It is not table based as cpuid(2).  So, we will not need changes to the
      kernel to support new cache descriptors in the descriptor table (as is
      the case with cpuid(2)).
    
    The patch also adds a bunch of interfaces under
    /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/cache, showing various information about the
    caches.  Most useful field being shared_cpu_map, which says what caches are
    shared among which logical cpus.
    
    The patch adds support for both i386 and x86-64.

    [PATCH] x86-64 kprobes: handle %RIP-relative addressing mode
    
    The existing x86-64 kprobes implementation doesn't cope with the
    %RIP-relative addressing mode.  Kprobes work by single-stepping a copy of
    an instruction overwritten by a breakpoint.  When a probe is inserted on an
    instruction that uses the %RIP-relative data addressing mode, the copy run
    in a different location gets different data and so the presence of that
    probe causes the probed code to read or write the wrong memory location.
    
    Without this problem fixed, it is woefully unsafe to use the current
    kprobes code on x86-64 unless you are sure the instruction you instrument
    is not one that accesses global data using the %RIP addressing mode.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by recognizing the %RIP-relative addressing
    mode in an instruction when it's being copied to insert the kprobe, and
    adjusting its displacement so that it finds the right data.  Taking this
    approach requires that the copied instruction's %RIP value be within 2GB of
    the virtual address of the data, i.e.  the text/data areas of the kernel
    code and loaded modules.  To satisfy this need the patch also replaces the
    use of vmalloc for getting instruction pages with lower-level calls to use
    a different part of the address space, the area at the top of the address
    space just above where modules are loaded.  I left one page of red zone at
    the top, and the 1MB-4KB thus available allows for at most 69632 kprobes.
    (If we ever need to overcome that limit, we can change this to add a hook
    into the arch/x86_64/kernel/modules.c code and allocate pages inside the
    module area loading area instead.)

    [PATCH] x86_64: avoid panic lockup
    
    This patch avoids a lockup with kernel.panic sysctl > 0, due an underflow
    of the number of the cpus.
    
    Later, Andrea said:
    
     While this still seems a needed fix, unfortunately this wasn't enough to
     fix the problem (the first positive report I got was because they did a
     mistake and they tested an UP kernel, oh well ;).
    
     Anyway the smp_stop_cpu executed by the cpu that invoked panic is wrong
     and it really causes an underflow of the number of cpus that can lead to
     further lockups. So I don't want to stop you from merging it since it
     seems a correct fix and it brings x86-64 in line with the x86 code too.
    
     But apparently we need something more than this too.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Add mem=X boot command line option
    
    This patch adds the mem=X boot command line option for PPC64.
    
    On iSeries the user's mem=X value is aligned to PAGE_SIZE, on pSeries we
    align to 16 MB which is the size of a large page.
    
    The iSeries implementation is fairly straight forward, we declare mem=X as
    an early_param() and then in iSeries_init_early() we modify the
    systemcfg->physicalMemorySize based on that value.
    
    On pSeries the mem=X option is parsed in prom_init.c before the kernel
    proper starts, and is used to modify prom_init_mem()'s idea of memory.  The
    mem=X value and computed tce_alloc_start/end values are saved by
    prom_init() into the device tree for later use by the kernel.
    
    The device tree properties are read by the kernel in
    early_dt_scan_chosen(), and used to modify the lmb structure in
    early_init_devtree().  That's the guts of it.
    
    On non-LPAR machines the tce_alloc_start/end values are read from the
    device tree and used in htab_initialize() to make sure the TCE table is
    mapped at the real top of RAM.
    
    If NUMA is enabled we also have to make changes in parse_numa_properties()
    and do_init_bootmem() to exclude memory regions above the memory limit, and
    truncate any region which stradles the limit.
    
    NB. This patch does not facilitate using mem=X to give drivers access to
    large regions of contiguous memory.

    [PATCH] ppc32: MPC8555 CPM2 size/pointers for FCCs aka "All-ones problem"
    
    I've seen that MPC8555 support also made it into linux-2.6 by now.
    
    I don't have hardware and time to test, but it looks like this bug has made
    it over from the linuxppc-2.4 tree.  The 8541/8555 has a smaller CPM DPRAM
    than the standard CPM2, just like the 8272.
    
    Unfortunately, the manual recommends you to use a segment of CPM DPRAM that
    is not implemented in the 8541/55.  If the smaller DPRAM is not taken into

    [PATCH] cpusets GFP_ATOMIC fix: tonedown panic comment
    
    This patch applies on top of my patch of March 26, entitled "cpusets
    special case GFP_ATOMIC allocs".  It tones down my panic'y commentary.
    
    My commentary shouldn't imply that failed GFP_ATOMICs should lead to, or
    normally lead to, panics.  Even though there are a few panic() calls
    following failed GFP_ATOMIC allocs, this is not the usual or desired result
    of a failed GFP_ATOMIC.  The kernel will probably drop some detail on the
    floor and keep on working.
    
    Thanks to Nick Piggin for noticing (I hope this answers his point.)

    		if (p < PAGE_SIZE && read > 0) {
    			[...]
    			read -= tmp;

        This part is losting the number of bytes which read.
    
    drivers/char/mem.c:302
    			sz = min_t(unsigned long, sz, count);
    
        This should use "read" instead of "count".

    			read -= sz;
    			count -= sz;
    
        Also lost the number of bytes which read.
    
    In short, kmem returns incorrect number always if user is accessing
    the lowmem area. And also it doesn't handle the highmem boundary
    rightly.
    
    This patch uses "low_count" instead of "read", as the number of copy
    in lowmem area. And "read" is used as the number of bytes which read.

    [PATCH] BDI: Provide backing device capability information [try #3]
    
    The attached patch replaces backing_dev_info::memory_backed with capabilitied
    bitmap. The capabilities available include:
    
      (*) BDI_CAP_NO_ACCT_DIRTY
    
          Set if the pages associated with this backing device should not be
          tracked by the dirty page accounting.
    
      (*) BDI_CAP_NO_WRITEBACK
    
          Set if dirty pages associated with this backing device should not have
          writepage() or writepages() invoked upon them to clean them.
    
      (*) Capability markers that indicate what a backing device is capable of
          with regard to memory mapping facilities. These flags indicate whether a
          device can be mapped directly, whether it can be copied for a mapping,
          and whether direct mappings can be read, written and/or executed. This
          information is primarily aimed at improving no-MMU private mapping
          support.
    
    The patch also provides convenience functions for determining the dirty-page
    capabilities available on backing devices directly or on the backing devices
    associated with a mapping. These are provided to keep line length down when
    checking for the capabilities.

    [PATCH] pcnet32: 79C975 fiber fix
    
    From: "HARDY, Steven" <steven.hardy@astrium.eads.net>
    
    I have found a bug in the pcnet32 driver (drivers/net/pcnet32.c)
    affecting all ethernet cards based on the AMD79C975 chip, using the
    fiber interface.
    
    It's a one line fix, where some config registers get corrupted during
    initialisation (which stops the Fiber interface working with this chip)
    
    This bug was introduced somewhere betweeen 2.4.17 and 2.6.x (noticed
    whilst upgrading to 2.6), and it may affect other chips too.  I have
    checked all versions up to 2.6.11-bk6 and they are all broken.

    [PATCH] S2io: Changed copyright and added support for Xframe II
    
    1. Change of Copyright to reflect S2io's new name "Neterion Inc."
    2. Updated driver version number.
    3. Add an additional PCI device id to support Neterion's new Xframe II.
    
    Some background info on Xframe-II, just in case -
    
    The NIC was announced back in January (see
    http://www.serverwatch.com/news/article.php/3464871)
    
    Xframe II is a PCI-X 2.0 DDR adapter designed to work in PCI-X 2.0 servers
    (it is also backwards compatible with current pci-x and pci slots); it's a
    first card to overcome pci-x 133 throughput bottleneck. Some of these pci-x
    2.0 servers are available now and more are coming later in the year.
    
    Xframe II is completely backward compatible and hence the current driver
    will work as-is, except the device id change.
    
    There are some additional features/stateless offloads in Xframe-II
    as well; we plan to submit patches for these soon.

    [PATCH] S2io: h/w initialization fixes
    
    Below patch addresses couple of issues w.r.t h/w initialization.
    
    1. The SWAPPER_CTRL register is now initialized as per recommended
       procedure from h/w team. This register when initialized correctly
       ensures correct access to other registers on big-endian and
       little-endian systems.
    2. Enabling the Continuous interrupt feature by default on Tx at
       a rate of 250 interrupts/sec.

    [PATCH] S2io: Statistics fix
    
    Below patch fixes the statistics problem on big-endian systems(such
    as IBM PPC).
    Basically, the problem was "ethtool -s" was reporting huge values
    on counters like no. of Tx frames, no. of Rx packets etc.
    The fix has been tested on little-endian and big-endian systems.

    [NETLINK]: Fix sk_rmem_alloc assertion failure.
    
    In netlink_dump we're operating on sk after dropping the cb lock.
    This is racy because the owner of the socket could close it after
    we drop the cb lock.
    
    This is possible because netlink_dump isn't always called from the
    context of the process that owns the socket.  For instance, if there
    is contention on rtnl then rtnetlink requests will be processed by
    the process that owns the rtnl.
    
    The solution is to hold a ref count on the socket before we drop
    the cb lock.

    [NETFILTER]: Restore ports module parameter for ip_nat_{ftp,irq}
    
    There is no 'ports' parameter for the ip_nat_ftp and ip_nat_irc modules in
    2.6.11: the ports parameter supplied to the
    ip_conntrack_ftp/ip_conntrack_irc module defines the ports.  It was
    unfortunate that we were lazy in the original implementation, and forced
    the user to duplicate the arguments.
    
    Even more unfortunate, the removal of the parameter caused autoloading to
    break for various setups, with an 'Unknown parameter' message.  The
    solution is to restore the parameter as a dummy, with a polite warning
    message that it is no longer neccessary.

    Fix SCSI internal requests hang
    
    When a device is being torn down (mostly in USB ejection)
    we hit conditions where SCSI hangs in wait_for_completion().
    The reason is that the scsi request prep function does a
    state check on the device and rejects it with BLKPREP_KILL if
    we're in the DEL (going away, no more I/O) state.
    
    Unfortunately, I/O submitted by scsi_wait_req() doesn't have
    its request->end_io initialised, so we're never notified of
    this (the submit path expects everything to come back via
    the scsi_request->sr_done() routine, which only happens
    if the I/O actually gets submitted.
    
    Note: almost everything that uses scsi_do_request() is wrong
    not only in this regard but also on other things, like ending
    tags.

    The flush was attempting to invalidate the coverage start virtual addresses

    the virtual address range. This patches places -1 in there instead, thus
    specifying 0xfc000000-0xffffffff which is covered by a static I/O mapping, and
    so shouldn't ever be seen by the TLB-miss handler.

    While fixing usb, I stomped on a few more fixes. Print error when some
    device fails to power down, and 2 is no longer valid state to pass in
    pm_message_t.

    [PATCH] USB: ohci D3 resume fix
    
    This fixes a problem that cropped up resuming OHCI from PCI D3 on
    NForce2.  Evidently the register controlling frame timing gets
    clobbered in D3, but not other registers ... a "by the book" reinit
    seems to solve this particular problem.  (And ought to help a few
    startup glitches on other implementations.  Linux never used that
    toggle bit before, and has had to struggle with glitchy init...)
    
    It also updates some diagnostics to be bit more useful, and tries
    to avoid a particular "wakeup while suspending" glitch that seems
    particular to one particular type of Australian mouse.

    [PATCH] USB: add driver for CP2101/CP2102 RS232 adaptors
    
    This patch against 2.6.10 provides the driver for the CP2101 and CP2102
    USB to RS232 adaptor chips which are found in some serial converter
    cables and usb mobile phone cables.
    
    It provides cp2101.c, and patches Kconfig and Makefile in
    drivers/usb/serial Since there is no technical data sheet freely
    available for these chips, much of the code in this driver has been
    based on protocol analysis, assumptions and guesswork.
    
    The cp210x family of devices have OEM programmable device IDs so updates
    will be required as and when new devices are found.
    
    The driver currently only supports configuration of baud rate, data
    bits, stop bits and parity mode. While this is enough to enable the use
    of a wide range of devices based on this chip, the driver is still
    incomplete in many areas such as flow control.  Unfortunately without
    technical datasheets, implementing these features is made very difficult
    indeed.

    [PATCH] fix fc class work queue usage
    
    According to this article http://lwn.net/Articles/125930/, "When
    cancel_delayed_work() returns zero, it means that the delayed
    work request was fired off before the call; it might, in fact,
    be running on another CPU when the cancel attempt is made".
    If it is successful, it returns a nonzero value. Tracing
    through cancel_delayed_work's timer usage would seem to confirm
    this. The fc class today though performs a flush_scheduled_work,
    when the return value is nonzero instead of zero.
    
    Also it appears the fc class will use flush_scheduled_work to
    flush the work from the shost_work_q when it should be using
    flush_workqueue(shost->work_q) (flush_scheduled_work() only
    flushes the default, keventd_wq, work queue).
    
    The attached patch adds a scsi_flush_work function for
    scsi_transport_fc to use and it fixes the cancel_delayed_work()
    test to detect when to flush the work queues correctly (it
    also only calls cancel_delayed_work when the work is queued
    as delayed (scan_work is not delayed).

    [PATCH] Add a scsi_device flag for RETRY_HWERROR
    
    It turns out that a bunch of USB-IDE converters make the mistake of
    returning SK = 04 (Hardware Error) whenever the IDE device signals any
    sort of error, without bothering to distinguish recoverable from
    non-recoverable errors.  The best way to handle this is for usb-storage to
    set a per-device flag indicating that these errors should always be
    retried.  The current scheme (blacklist flag but no per-device flag) isn't
    well suited for this situation.
    
    This patch adds the per-device flag and sets it initially based on the
    blacklist setting.  Once this has been merged, a separate patch will be
    submitted to Matt Dharm adding the corresponding support to usb-storage.

    [ARM] Fix ARM TLB shootdown code
    
    We missed flushing the TLB when we're unmapping only reserved pages.
    Since the kernel is now better at passing vmas which correspond
    solely with the region to unmap, we can use tlb_*_vma() to do
    "just enough" flushing, both for the TLB and cache.
    
    We can avoid all flushes in tlb_*_vma() for the full-MM case, and
    just do a flush_tlb_mm().  We can omit the cache flushing because
    this thread will die soon.

    [PATCH] ext3: fix journal_unmap_buffer race
    
    There is a race condition in jbd between journal_unmap_buffer() and
    journal_commit_transaction().  This is leading to corruption of buffers on the
    transaction's t_locked_list, leading to a variety of symptoms usually
    involving an oops in kjournald.
    
    The problem is that various special-case exit paths in journal_unmap_buffer()
    call journal_put_journal_head without any locking.  This is racing against a
    refiling of the same journal_head in journal_commit_transaction():
    
    			__journal_unfile_buffer(jh);
    			__journal_file_buffer(jh, commit_transaction,
    						BJ_Locked);
    
    The way these functions work, this leaves the jh temporarily with
    b_transaction==NULL; and if journal_unmap_buffer()'s call to
    journal_put_journal_head() hits this window, it sees the NULL transaction and
    frees the journal_head which is just about to get refiled on the locked list.
    
    The main exit path on journal_unmap_buffer() performs its
    journal_put_journal_head() before dropping the j_list_lock, so is not
    vulnerable to this race.  The fix is to move the other similar calls on
    special-case exit branches in that function so that they also release the
    journal_head before dropping that lock.
    
    This is low-risk since the new order has already been tested as the normal
    exit path from this function.  The change has had extensive testing and has
    been shown to fix the problem with no regressions found.

    [PATCH] ext3/jbd race: releasing in-use journal_heads
    
    Fix destruction of in-use journal_head
    
    journal_put_journal_head() can destroy a journal_head at any time as
    long as the jh's b_jcount is zero and b_transaction is NULL.  It has no
    locking protection against the rest of the journaling code, as the lock
    it uses to protect b_jcount and bh->b_private is not used elsewhere in
    jbd.
    
    However, there are small windows where b_transaction is getting set
    temporarily to NULL during normal operations; typically this is
    happening in
    
    			__journal_unfile_buffer(jh);
     			__journal_file_buffer(jh, ...);
    
    call pairs, as __journal_unfile_buffer() will set b_transaction to NULL
    and __journal_file_buffer() re-sets it afterwards.  A truncate running
    in parallel can lead to journal_unmap_buffer() destroying the jh if it
    occurs between these two calls.
    
    Fix this by adding a variant of __journal_unfile_buffer() which is only
    used for these temporary jh unlinks, and which leaves the b_transaction
    field intact so that we never leave a window open where b_transaction is
    NULL.
    
    Additionally, trap this error if it does occur, by checking against
    jh->b_jlist being non-null when we destroy a jh.

      functions is uses;
    o balance the error path in av7110_attach and have it easy to check.
      Please check it;
    o if everything is correctly balanced, device_initialized is not needed
      anymore in struct av7110;
    o av7110_detach(): no need to cast a void * pointer;
    o av7110_detach(): die #ifdef, die !
    o change the returned value of av7110_av_exit() as it can't fail;
    o change the returned value of av7110_ca_init() as it can fail. Removed
      extraneous casts while are it;
    o check for failure of vmalloc() in ci_ll_init().
    o vfree(NULL) is safe.

    [PATCH] Netmos parallel/serial/combo support
    
    There's a bugzilla entry for this here:
        http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4334
    
    This should fix all the problems I know about with Netmos combo cards:
        - 9735, 9835, and 9855 are not supported
        - combo cards with parallel are erroneously claimed by serial driver
        - serial and parport_serial blindly probe for ports
    
    parport_pc:
        Sort Netmos device IDs, no functional change.
    parport_serial:
        Previously supported 9735 and 9835.  Add 9745, 9845, 9855, and
        add init hooks to discover how many serial/parallel ports are
        actually present (the boards are available in various configs).
        Add protection for overflow of static tables.
    quirks:
        Detect Netmos combo (parallel + serial) cards and change class from
        SERIAL to OTHER to prevent serial driver from claiming them.
    8250:
        Add init hook to discover the number of serial ports present.
        This prevents us from poking at unused BARs.
    pci_ids:
        Add Netmos 9745, 9845, and sort.

    [PATCH] arch hook for notifying changes in PTE protections bits
    
     Recently on IA-64, we have found an issue where old data could be used by
     apps.  The sequence of operations includes few mprotects from user space
     (glibc) goes like this:
    
     1- The text region of an executable is mmaped using
        PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC.  As a result, a shared page is allocated to user.
    
     2- User then requests the text region to be mprotected with
        PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE.  Kernel removes the execute permission and leave
        the read permission on the text region.
    
     3- Subsequent write operation by user results in page fault and
        eventually resulting in COW break.  User gets a new private copy of the
        page.  At this point kernel marks the new page for defered flush.
    
     4- User then request the text region to be mprotected back with
        PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC.  mprotect suppport code in kernel, flushes the
        caches, updates the PTEs and then flushes the TLBs.  Though after
        updating the PTEs with new permissions, we don't let the arch specific
        code know about the new mappings (through update_mmu_cache like
        routine).  IA-64 typically uses update_mmu_cache to check for the
        defered flush flag (that got set in step 3) to maintain cache coherency
        lazily (The local I and D caches on IA-64 are incoherent).
    
    DavidM suggeested that we would need to add a hook in the function
    change_pte_range in mm/mprotect.c This would let the architecture specific
    code to look at the new ptes to decide if it needs to update any other
    architectual/kernel state based on the updated (new permissions) PTE
    values.
    
    We have added a new hook lazy_mmu_prot_update(pte_t) that gets called
    protection bits in PTEs change.  This hook provides an opportunity to arch
    specific code to do needful.  On IA-64 this will be used for lazily making
    the I and D caches coherent.

    MSDOS doesn't have ->adate and ->c{date,time}, those should be filled
    by zero.
    
    This fixes my recent changes.

    [PATCH] pcmcia: clean up suspend
    
    Where suspend is implemented, all socket drivers set their socket state to
    "dead_socket" as the first thing in their suspend ops method.  Factor this
    out to the core PCMCIA code.
    
    This allows us to kill some suspend methods, and reduce the references to
    "dead_socket".  Note that the suspend ops method is now optional.

    [PATCH] io_remap_pfn_range: add for all arch-es
    
    This patch introduces a new interface function for mapping bus/device memory:
    io_remap_pfn_range.  This accepts the same parameters as remap_pfn_range and
    io_remap_page_range but should be used in any situation where the caller is
    not simply remapping ordinary RAM.  For example, when mapping device registers
    the new function should be used.
    
    The distinction between remapping device memory and ordinary RAM is critical
    for the Xen hypervisor.
    
    This patch series also cleans up the remaining users of io_remap_page_range
    (in particular, the several sparc-specific sections in various drivers that
    use a special form of io_remap_page_range: an extra <iospace> argument for
    SPARC arch.) by converting them to use io_remap_pfn_range(), where
    io_remap_pfn_range() supports passing <iospace> as part of the pfn argument.
    
    The sparc32 & sparc64 code needs live testing.

    [PATCH] ext2/3 file limits to avoid overflowing i_blocks
    
    As discussed before, we can overflow i_blocks in ext2/ext3 inodes by
    growing a file up to 2TB.  That gives us 2^32 sectors of data in the file;
    but once you add on the indirect tree and possible EA/ACL metadata,
    i_blocks will wrap beyond 2^32.  Consensus seemed to be that the best way
    to avoid this was simply to stop files getting so large that this was a
    problem in the first place; anything else would lead to complications if a
    sparse file tried to overflow that 2^32 sector limit while filling in
    holes.
    
    I wrote a small program to calculate the total indirect tree overhead for
    any given file size, and 0x1ff7fffe000 turned out to be the largest file we
    can get without the total i_blocks overflowing 2^32.
    
    But in testing, that *just* wrapped --- we need to limit the file to be one
    page smaller than that to deal with the possibility of an EA/ACL block
    being accounted against i_blocks.
    
    So this patch has been tested, at least on ext3, by letting a file grow
    densely to its maximum size permitted by the kernel; at 0x1ff7fffe000, stat
    shows the file to have wrapped back exactly to 0 st_blocks, but with the
    limit at 0x1ff7fffd000, du shows it occupying the expected 2TB-blocksize
    bytes.

    [PATCH] posix-cpu-timers and cputime_t divisons.
    
    The posix cpu timers introduced code that will not work with an arbitrary
    type for cputime_t.  In particular the division of two cputime_t values
    broke the s390 build because cputime_t is define as an unsigned long long.
    
    The first problem is the division of a cputime_t value by a number of
    threads.  That is a cputime_t divided by an integer.  The patch adds
    another macro cputime_div to the cputime macro regime which implements this
    type of division and replaces all occurences of a cputime / nthread in the
    posix cpu timer code.
    
    Next problem is bump_cpu_timer. This function is severly broken:
    
    1) In the body of the first if statement a timer->it.cpu.incr.sched is
       used as the second argument of do_div.  do_div expects an unsigned long
       as "base" parameter but timer->it.cpu.incr.sched is an unsigned long
       long.  If the timer increment ever happens to be >= 2^32 the result is
       wrong and if the lower 32 bits are zero this even crashes with a fixed
       point divide exception.
    
    2) The cputime_le(now.cpu, timer->it.cpu.expires.cpu) in the else if
       condition is wrong.  The cputime_le() reads as "now.cpu <=
       timer->it.cpu.expires.cpu" and the subsequent cputime_ge() reads as
       "now.cpu >= timer.it.cpu.expires.cpu".  That means that the two values
       needs to be equal to make the body of the second if to have any effect.
       The first cputime_le should be a cputime_ge.
    
    3) timer->it.cpu.expires.cpu and delta in the else part of the if are of
       type cputime_t.  A division of two cputime_t values is undefined (think
       of cputime_t as e.g.  a struct timespec, that just doesn't work).  We
       could add a primitive for this type of division but we'd end up with a
       64 bit division or something even more complicated.
    
    The solution for bump_cpu_timer is to use the "slow" division algorithm
    that does shifts and subtracts.  That adds yet another cputime macro,
    cputime_halve to do the right shift of a cputime value.
    
    The next problem is in arm_timer.  The UPDATE_CLOCK macro does the wrong
    thing for it_prof_expires and it_virt_expires.  Expanded the macro and
    added the cputime magic to it_prof/it_virt.
    
    The remaining problems are rather simple, timespec_to_jiffies instead of
    timespec_to_cputime and several cases where cputime_eq with cputime_zero
    needs to be used instead of "== 0".
    
    What still worries me a bit is to use "timer->it.cpu.incr.sched == 0" as
    check if the timer is armed at all.  It should work but its not really
    clean.

    [PATCH] cpusets: alloc GFP_WAIT sleep fix
    
    The cpuset mems_allowed update code in alloc_pages_current could (in
    theory) put a task to sleep that didn't allow sleeping (did not have
    __GFP_WAIT flag set).  In the rare circumstance that the current tasks
    mems_generation is outofdate compared to the tasks cpuset mems_generation,
    this mems_allowed update code needs to grap cpuset_sem, which can sleep.
    
    We avoid this by not trying to update mems_allowed here if we can't sleep
    (__GFP_WAIT not set).

    [PATCH] cpusets: mems generation deadlock fix
    
    The cpuset code to update mems_generation could (in theory) deadlock on
    cpuset_sem if it needed to allocate some memory while creating (mkdir) or
    removing (rmdir) a cpuset, so already held cpuset_sem.  Some other process
    would have to mess with this tasks cpuset memory placement at the same
    time.
    
    We avoid this possible deadlock by always updating mems_generation after we
    grab cpuset_sem on such operations, before we risk any operations that
    might require memory allocation.

    [PATCH] New console flag: CON_BOOT
    
    CON_BOOT is like early printk in that it allows for output really early on.
     It's better than early printk because it unregisters automatically when a
    real console is initialised.  So if you don't get consoles registering in
    console_init, there isn't a huge delay between the boot console
    unregistering and the real console starting.  This is the case on PA-RISC
    where we have serial ports that aren't discovered until the PCI bus has
    been walked.
    
    I think all the current early printk users could be converted to this
    scheme with a minimal amount of effort.

    [PATCH] InfiniBand: remove unsafe use of in_atomic()
    
    Using in_atomic() to decide between GFP_KERNEL and GFP_ATOMIC is not safe
    (it doesn't work if CONFIG_PREEMPT=n).  Change to just always allocating
    with GFP_ATOMIC, since we don't know if we can sleep or not.

    [PATCH] Per cpu irq stat
    
    The definition of the irq_stat as an array means that the individual
    elements of the irq_stat array are located on one NUMA node requiring
    internode traffic to access irq_stat from other nodes.  This patch makes
    irq_stat a per_cpu variable which allows most accesses to be local.

    [PATCH] Fix irq_affinity write from /proc for ia64
    
    Made GENERIC_HARDIRQ mechanism work for ia64 and CPU hotplug.  When write
    to /proc/irq is handled it is not appropriate to perform set_rte
    immediatly, since there is a race when the interrupt is asserted while the
    re-program is happening.  Hence such programming is only safe when we do
    the re-program at the time of servicing an interrupt.  This got broken when
    GENERIC_HARDIRQ got introduced for ia64.
    
    - added CONFIG_PENDING_IRQ so default /proc/irq write handler can do the right
      thing.
    
    TBD: We currently dont handle redirectable hint either in the display, or
    when we handle writes to /proc/irq/XX/smp_affinity.  We need an arch
    specific way to account for the presence of "r" hint when we handle the
    proc write.

    Fix sort behavior when long names are encountered.  The previour regular
    expression depended on a tab to find the size in a string.  For long names,
    this tab no longer exists, so it is smarter to check for a colon instead.
    
    For the kernel, this change shouldn't make a difference.  But people
    started using the same script for c++ code in other projects.

    [PATCH] break_lock fix
    
    lock->break_lock is set when a lock is contended, but cleared only in
    cond_resched_lock.  Users of need_lockbreak (journal_commit_transaction,
    copy_pte_range, unmap_vmas) don't necessarily use cond_resched_lock on it.
    
    So, if the lock has been contended at some time in the past, break_lock
    remains set thereafter, and the fastpath keeps dropping lock unnecessarily.
     Hanging the system if you make a change like I did, forever restarting a
    loop before making any progress.  And even users of cond_resched_lock may
    well suffer an initial unnecessary lockbreak.
    
    There seems to be no point at which break_lock can be cleared when
    unlocking, any point being either too early or too late; but that's okay,
    it's only of interest while the lock is held.  So clear it whenever the
    lock is acquired - and any waiting contenders will quickly set it again.
    Additional locking overhead?  well, this is only when CONFIG_PREEMPT is on.
    
    Since cond_resched_lock's spin_lock clears break_lock, no need to clear it
    itself; and use need_lockbreak there too, preferring optimizer to #ifdefs.

    [PATCH] Can't unmount bad inode
    
    This patch fixes a problem when a inode which is the root of a mount
    becomes bad (make_bad_inode()).  In this case follow_link will return
    -EIO, so the name resolution fails, and umount won't work.  The
    solution is just to remove the follow_link method from bad_inode_ops.
    Any filesystem operation (other than unmount) will still fail, since
    every other method returns -EIO.
    
    A test case for this is:
    
     1) export an smbfs on host A and mount the share on host B
    
     2) create directory X on A under the exported directory
    
     3) bind mount X to Y on B (Y need not be under the share)
    
     4) remove directory X, and create regular file X (same name) on A
    
     5) stat X on B, this will make X a bad inode (file type changed)
    
     6) umount Y
    
    Without the patch applied, umount won't succeed, and a reboot is
    necessary to get rid of the mount.
    
    With the patch applied, umount will succeed.
    
    The same is true for any filesystem which uses make_bad_inode() to
    mark an existing inode bad (NFS, SMBFS, FUSE, etc...).

    [PATCH] uml: fix "cond. expr. as lvalues" warning
    
    Gcc 3.4.3 (and probably any 3.4) emits some "deprecation" warnings currently
    about usages of CHOOSE_MODE, since the below syntax has been deprecated:
    
    (a ? foo: bar) = foobar;
    which often results from expansion of:
    CHOOSE_MODE(foo, bar) = foobar;
    
    So add an additional __CHOOSE_MODE syntax for users which need to get a
    lvalue, which uses (a ? &foo : &bar) inside a function, casts the result to
    the correct type and dereference the pointer, and use it where needed (i.e.
    in <sysdep/ptrace.h>)
    
    The patch builds and runs correctly (this has been tested on i386 only, not on
    x86_64), and removes all the warnings.

    being overriden by the real definition when GCC defines it (recent ones).
    
    Can't be implemented as a test on GCC version because SuSE has a crippled GCC,
    declared as 3.3.4 but having a lot of backported features.
    
    Also, since gcc 3.4.3 requires profiling options even during linking, add
    profiling options to final link stage.

    [PATCH] uml: factor out common code in user-obj handling
    
    With Vadim Abrossimov <vadim_abrossimov@yahoo.com>
    
    *) Handle USER_OBJS through the general Kbuild infrastructure; the trick we
       use is to change c_flags only for USER_OBJS.
    
       This ain't at all worse than the previous kludgy solution, enables us to
       use a better dependency handling and to support MODVERSIONS.
    
       And it is UML-specific, as a bonus.
    
       So, no "it ain't clean enough" reasoning is allowed to hold this patch
       until you find a better solution.  Leaving there the current broken code is
       not accepted.
    
    *) Move similar definitions from Makefiles to the newly created
       arch/um/scripts/Makefile.rules and include it everywhere needed.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Fix NMI RTC access race
    
    Fix NMI RTC access race
    
    This patch fixes a race between the CMOS clock setting and the NMI code.  The
    NMI code indiscriminatly sets index registers and values in the same place the
    CMOS clock is set.  If you are setting the CMOS clock and an NMI occurs, Bad
    values could be written to or read from the CMOS RAM, or the NMI operation
    might not occur correctly.
    
    Resetting the NMI is not required on x86_64 (in fact, it should not be done
    according to the ICH5 documentation).  This patch simply removes the useless
    code.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Work around Tyan BIOS MTRR initialization bug.
    
    Work around Tyan BIOS MTRR initialization bug.
    
    Some Tyan AMD BIOS don't initialize the first fixed range MTRR, which causes
    it to contain random bogus values.  When the MTRR tries to duplicate the MTRR
    state to other CPUs at startup it oopses because of this.
    
    This patch works around this by catching exception while setting MTRRs.
    
    It would be better to validate all fixed range MTRRs and fix them, but that
    would be very complicated code.  This simple hack seems to work too (except
    that the first 64k of physical memory are likely uncached).  A BIOS update
    fixes that.

    This is already implemented for __put_user_size(), somehow I overlooked

    [PATCH] x86: CMOS time update optimisation
    
    This patch changes the update of the cmos clock to be timer driven rather
    than poll driven by the timer interrupt function.  If the clock is not
    being synced to an outside source the timer is removed and thus system
    overhead is nill in that case.  The update frequency is still ~11 minutes
    and missing the update window still causes a retry in 60 seconds.
    
    We want the calls to sync_cmos_clock() to be made in a consistent environment.
    This was not true when calling it directly from the NTP call code.  The
    change means that sync_cmos_clock() is ALWAYS called from run_timers(), i.e.
    as a timer call back function.
    
    Also, call the timer code only through the timer interface (set a short timer
    to do it from the ntp call).

    [PATCH] ppc64: numa: Remove redundant and broken overlap check
    
    The numa code used to have to handle the fact that memory regions (as
    reported by OF) had been coallesced in the lmb struct and so might overlap
    node boundaries.
    
    Since Mike's patch went in this doesn't happen anymore, because we iterate
    over the memory regions from OF directly.  This patch simply removes a
    check that catered for the overlapping case, which now "can't happen".
    
    The condition also happens to be broken in the current code, but in a
    painless way, so it's as good as removed already.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix ethernet PHY reset on iMac G5
    
    On iMac G5, when netbooting (or causing any other ethernet activity from
    within the Open Firmware environment), the PHY is put into a low power
    state before booting the OS.  The result is that Linux doesn't see it and
    networking doesn't work.
    
    This patch adds the ethernet PHY reset platform hook to pmac_feature.c on
    ppc64 (it already is commonly used on ppc32 as lots of macs have this same
    problem, so the hook definition is already there and sungem is already
    calling it).

    [PATCH] ppc32/64: Map prefetchable PCI without guarded bit
    
    While experimenting with framebuffer access performances, we noticed a very
    significant improvement in write access to it when not setting the
    "guarded" bit on the MMU mappings.  This bit basically says that reads and
    writes won't have side effects (it allows speculation).  It appears that it
    also disables write combining.
    
    This patch implements a new phys_mem_access_prot() arch callback for use by
    /dev/mem and fbdev when available, implements it for ppc32 and ppc64, and
    modifies /dev/mem and fbdev to use it, respectively when available or on
    ppc.  I didn't change fbdev to use it on all archs when available because
    there is already a whole lot of arch specific mess in there (more than in
    /dev/mem !) that I didn't feel like messing with, but archs maintainers are
    welcome to give it a go).
    
    The old mechanism in /dev/mem is still there, but arch maintainers should
    probably switch to this once which is more consistent imho.
    
    Finally, the ppc32 and ppc64 implementation of this and of the PCI mmap
    calls (used by /proc and /sys) are modified to check if the mapping happens
    in a prefetchable PCI resource, in which case, the guarded bit is not set
    for the pgprot.  In fact, ppc32 implementation of this code is updated to
    be identical to ppc64.
    
    This improves framebuffer write performance on a simple test paul wrote
    from about 50Mb/sec to 200Mb/sec on my M9 based laptop and on a G5.  The
    new hook will automatically catch up Xfree mmap's from /dev/mem, so it will
    work out of the box with existing X servers.  Kernel fbdev accesses aren't
    improved yet as ioremap doesn't use that mecanism.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix Sandpoint Soft Reboot
    
    This patch allows the Freescale Sandpoint to perform soft reboots.  A write
    of 0x00 to the Winbond's Chip Select Control Register was clearing the
    Upper BIOS Chip Select Enable bit which unmaps the boot flash.  The comment
    associated with the write noted that it was enabling the RTC and Keyboard
    address locations, but the bits in question (1 and 0) are reserved when the
    Winbond chip is in PowerPC mode.  Also, the bits are 1 for enable, 0 for
    disable, therefore the original code was actually disabling the address
    locations.  The patch also corrects errors in the definitions of 2
    configuration bits in the Tundra Tsi107 bridge's MAPB Options register.

    [PATCH] unused 'size' assignment in filemap_nopage
    
    filemap_nopage has the following code:
    
    retry_all:
    	size = (i_size_read(inode) + PAGE_CACHE_SIZE - 1) >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
    	if (pgoff >= size)
    		goto outside_data_content;
    
    	/* If we don't want any read-ahead, don't bother */
    	if (VM_RandomReadHint(area))
    		goto no_cached_page;
    
    	/*
    	 * The "size" of the file, as far as mmap is concerned, isn't bigger
    	 * than the mapping
    	 */
    	if (size > endoff)
    		size = endoff;
    
    After this, size is not referenced.  So, either this potential reassignment
    of size is superfluous, or we are missing some other code later on in the
    function.  If it is the former, I've attached a patch which will remove the
    code.
    
    (akpm: and endoff can go away too.  That was the unused variable which gcc has
    been warning about for ages.  Also, gratuitous whitespace fiddling).

    [PATCH] mm counter operations through macros
    
    This patch extracts all the operations on counters protected by the page
    table lock (currently rss and anon_rss) into definitions in
    include/linux/sched.h.  All rss operations are performed through the
    following macros:
    
    get_mm_counter(mm, member)		-> Obtain the value of a counter
    set_mm_counter(mm, member, value)	-> Set the value of a counter
    update_mm_counter(mm, member, value)	-> Add to a counter
    inc_mm_counter(mm, member)		-> Increment a counter
    dec_mm_counter(mm, member)		-> Decrement a counter
    
    With this patch it becomes easier to add new counters and it is possible to
    redefine the method of counter handling.  The counters are an issue for
    scalability since they are used in frequently used code paths and may cause
    cache line bouncing.
    
    F.e. One may not use counters at all and count the pages when needed, switch
    to atomic operations if the mm_struct locking changes or split the rss
    into counters that can be locally incremented.
    
    The relevant fields of the task_struct are renamed with a leading underscore
    to catch out people who are not using the acceessor macros.

    [PATCH] slab.[ch]: kmalloc() cleanups
    
    I found a new idea for optimizing the loop in kmalloc - now the cleanup
    both reduces the size of the .text segment in mm/slab.o and speeds up largs
    kmallocs a bit.  I still loose 2 cycles for kmalloc(32,GFP_KERNEL) compared
    to the current code, but I haven't figured out how I could optimize
    further.
    
    - inline kmem_find_general_cachep()
    
    - optimize kmem_find_general_cachep() and document the optimization.
    
    - remove duplicate code from __kmalloc(): call kmem_find_general_cachep()
      directly.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix AIO panic on PPC64 caused by is_hugepage_only_range()
    
    When testing AIO on PPC64 (a power5 machine) running 2.6.11 with
    CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE=y, I ran into a kernel panic when a process exits that has
    done AIO (io_queue_init()) but has not done the io_queue_release().  The
    exit_aio() code is cleaning up and panicking when trying to free the aio ring
    buffer.
    
    I tracked this down to is_hugepage_only_range() (include/asm-ppc64/page.h)
    which is doing a touches_hugepage_low_range() which is checking
    current->mm->context.htlb_segs.  The problem is that exit_mm() cleared tsk->mm
    before doing the mmput() which leads to the exit_aio() and then the panic.
    Looks like is_hugepage_only_range() is only used in ia64 and ppc64.  Fix is to
    change is_hugepage_only_range() to take an 'mm' as a parameter as well as
    'addr' and 'len' and then the ppc64 code could change to use 'mm'.  It looks
    like it has been broken for quite a while.

    [PATCH] pcmcia: don't send eject request events to userspace
    
    Here follow PCMCIA-related patches which allow for kernel-based matching
    between 16-bit PCMCIA devices and their drivers.  If you're using this (and
    using a special startup script or small tool), you don't need to run "cardmgr"
    any longer.  cardmgr still works, though, allowing for a gradual transition.
    
    These patches apply on top of what's in 2.6.11-rc4-mm1; for proper operation
    pcmcia-bridge-resource-management-fix.patch should be removed first, though.
    Andrew, please apply them to your next -mm release.
    
    
    1. Theory of operation I: setting up the sockets
    ================================================
    - the appropriate socket driver is initialized (modprobe or built-in)
    - a hotplug event (CLASS=pcmcia_socket) is generated
    - if it's a socket which doesn't map the resources statically, resources
      available for use by PCMCIA cards need to be marked as "allowed". This is
      done using either a small shell script[*] or pcmcia-socket-startup[**]. The
      latter parses /etc/pcmcia/config.opts -- the same file cardmgr currently
      uses for this purpose.
    
    [*] e.g.
    #!/bin/sh
    echo -n "+ 0x00000100 - 0x000004cf" > /sys/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket1/available_resources_io
    echo -n "+ 0x60000000 - 0x60ffffff" > /sys/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket1/available_resources_mem
    echo -n "1" > /sys/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket1/available_resources_setup_done
    
    [**] note: for pcmcia-socket-startup to work properly you need a patch for
         libsysfs (it is already accepted by the maintainer of the package). See
         below for details.
    
    
    2. Theory of operation II: setting up a device
    ==============================================
    - a pcmcia device is discovered in the socket
    - device information is determined and exported to sysfs
    - a hotplug event is created, passing -- among others -- a complete MODNAME
      string to userspace. Available match flags are the product ID strings [in
      userspace, only the hashes are matched -- you can't use strings in
      modules.alias], manufactor and card ID, the multifunction device number,
      the pseudo-multifunction device number [this is what e.g.
    	bind "serial_cs", bind "serial_cs"
      was before], whether it needs a CIS override, and the function ID [this match
      is only used if it is allowed by userspace -- it should be avoided and will
      be removed in future, after existing users have been converted to matches of
      other types].
    - modprobe $MODNAME [*]
    - the device is matched against drivers. function ID matches are ignored at
      this stage. If the device needs a CIS override, it is requested from
      userspace using the firmware helpers. It is recommended to have a symlink
      either from  /lib/firmware/cis/ to /etc/pcmcia/cis/ or the other way to let
      both (old) cardmgr and (new) firmware.agent access the override CIS data.
    - if no driver was found, an userspace helper checks whether the card is one of
      two(!) which can only be detected using cardmgr's tuple directive. If this is
      the case, a CIS override is done using
      /sys/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket%n/cis , loading a CIS with proper
      identification values.
    - if this doesn't lead to a driver being bound to the device, function ID-based
      matches are allowed.
    
    [*] note: for this to work properly you need a patch to be written which loads
        _all_ matching modules, not just one]
    
    
    3. patches
    ==========
    I'll not send the patches which add the proper device identification tables to
    this list, but only (and a bit later) to Andrew and the appropriate
    maintainers. You can find them already at
    http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/brodo/patches/2.6.11-rc5/
    -- they start with pcmcia-25-
    
    I used all identification information I could find in pcmcia-cs, the kernel,
    and some web resources and, but probably missed some. If I did, please send
    me either the appropriate device info from the cardmgr config file or the
    output of "pcmcia-modalias" (see below) -- or a PCMCIA_MATCH patch.
    
    
    4. userspace tools
    ==================
    Several GPL[*] userspace tools are required or useful for this (new) method of
    operation. I'll send them to this list for review, and they're also available
    _temporarily_ at
    http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/brodo/temp-pcmcia-tools.tar.gz
    
    I'm still undecided on what to do with these userspace tools. IMO they could
    either be merged into pcmcia-cs or distributed in addition to pcmcia-cs. Also,
    I'd be very glad if somebody else could maintain and improve these tools.
    
    pcmcia-socket-startup
    This tool is based on "cardmgr" by Dave Hinds, but most of it was removed. The
    remains parse the /etc/pcmcia/config file for allowed ioport and iomem ranges
    and for disallowed IRQs, and sets these using libsysfs. Due to a bug in
    libsysfs, a patch is needed for this to work properly. It takes one parameter,
    the socket number to be set up.
    
    
    pcmcia-modalias
    This tool reads device information and generates a MODALIAS string just like
    the kernel exports using hotplug for this device. It takes one paramter, the
    device's bus_id string (e.g. "pcmcia-modalias 1.0" for the first device on the
    second PCMCIA socket)
    
    
    pcmcia-check-broken-cis
    This checks whether the CIS is so broken that only the "tuple"-based match is
    possible. It takes one parameter, the socket the PCMCIA card to be tested is
    inserted to, and returns nothing (if no CIS override is needed), or the CIS
    file name. The CIS parsing is done using a much simplified version of what
    is to be found in drivers/pcmcia/cistpl.c, so this is based on Dave Hinds
    work as well.
    
    
    hotplug/pcmcia*
    The hotplug scripts are quite self-explanatory and also allow for "coldplug"
    (i.e. they work around "missed" events during boot).
    
    
    pccardctl
    This previously announced tool uses sysfs instead of an ioctl for commands
    like "eject", "insert", "info" and "ident".
    
    
    [*] reason: they're partly based on other GPL-licensed tools.
    
    
    This patch:
    
    
    Don't inform cardmgr of ejection requests so that "cardctl eject" behaves
    _exactly_ the same as a physical ejection from an userspace point of view.
    
    Removing this allows us to clean up some other code which is otherwise unused.

    struct socket_data wasn't zeroed, so pcmcia_validate_mem() didn't get called.
    If it is called, though, one possible code-path already holds skt_sem, so

    kmalloc() and friends, since silent integer promotion is now caught by

    [SPARC64]: Support >=cheetah+ dual-dtlbs properly.
    
    UltraSPARC-III+ (aka. cheetah+) and later chips have three
    D-TLB units.  One is fully assosciative and has 16 entries,
    the other two have 512 entries each and are 2 way subblocked
    and then indexed by the PAGE_MASK bits.  This implies that
    the two 512 entry TLBs need to know the page size in order
    to index things properly.
    
    The page size to use is encoded in page size fields within
    the TLB context registers.
    
    Up until this point we just left them at zero, which meant
    that both 512 entry TLBs were used for 8K translations only.
    The rest (including the 4MB kernel mappings) went into the
    16 entry fully assosciative TLB.
    
    Now, for the kernel, we use the first 512 entries for 4MB
    mappings and the second 512 entries for PAGE_SIZE mappings
    (ie. for vmalloc and modules).  For the user, we use the
    first 512 entries for PAGE_SIZE and the second 512 entries
    for HPAGE_SIZE if the user maps any hugetlb pages else we
    use the second half for user PAGE_SIZE stuff as well.
    
    Most of this changeset is clerical.  We move most of the
    mm->context layout defines into asm/mmu.h, we abstract the
    mm->context type so that it is now much easier to see and
    trap accesses to the context values.  In particular, one
    can find all context handling by grepping the sparc64 sources
    for CTX_* and {PRIMARY,SECONDAY}_CONTEXT.
    
    Happily, the fast paths of the kernel are mostly untouched
    by this new stuff.  We add 2 cycles to trap entry, 1 cycle
    to trap exit, and 2 cycles to the window trap fixup code.

    [PATCH] USB: fix shared key auth in zd1201
    
    It's currently impossible to associate with a shared-key-only access
    point using the zd1201 driver. The attached patch fixes it. The reason
    was (probably) a typo in the definitions of the authentification types.
    I found that they should be (1,2) instead of (0,1) by looking at the
    old linux-wlan-ng driver by Zydas.

    [ARM PATCH] 2576/1: Fix LDRD and LDRSB (Thumb) abort handling
    
    Patch from Deepak Saxena
    
    The ARM LDRD (v5+) and Thumb LDRSB instructions use bit 20/11 (ARM/Thumb)
    differently than every other instruction, so it is set to 0 (write) even
    though the instructions are read instructions. This means that during an
    abort the instructions will be treated as a write and the handler will
    raise a signal from unwriteable locations if they fault. We have to
    specifically check for these instructions from the abort handlers to
    treat them properly. EABI toolchains emit LDRD instructions and even
    those not using EABI might have handcoded ASM that uses these instructions.
    This patch creates an abort-macro.S file that is included by the
    abort-ev* files that need the special cases and changes those
    handlers to use the macros.  ARMv6 does not need the special case
    handling as the HW takes care of setting the FSR bit appropriately.

    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    It is pointless for cases where one tries to boot a kernel
    on the wrong ARM subarchitecture, but for those cases where the
    architecture is similar enough so the low level routines do work
    then something a bit more informative than "Error: a" might be
    handy, especially when the bootloader is the culprit.
    All extra strings are compiled in only if CONFIG_DEBUG_LL
    is selected of course.

    Add '__nocast' sparse annotation to allow people to mark places
    where implicit casts are not appropriate.
    
    This can be used to mark unsigned integers as being uncastable
    to signed, for example. Or enums as not degrading to integers
    and vice versa.

commit 15d26df09084ff3a891a696efd0d56b52d852e24
Author: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@toy.ghostprotocols.net>

    [NET] make all protos partially use sk_prot
    
    sk_alloc_slab becomes proto_register, that receives a struct proto not necessarily
    completely filled, but at least with the proto name, owner and obj_size (aka proto
    specific sock size), with this we can remove the struct sock sk_owner and sk_slab,
    using sk->sk_prot->{owner,slab} instead.
    
    This patch also makes sk_set_owner not necessary anymore, as at sk_alloc time we
    have now access to the struct proto onwer and slab members, so we can bump the
    module refcount exactly at sock allocation time.
    
    Another nice "side effect" is that this patch removes the generic sk_cachep slab
    cache, making the only last two protocols that used it use just kmalloc, informing
    a struct proto obj_size equal to sizeof(struct sock).
    
    Ah, almost forgot that with this patch it is very easy to use a slab cache, as it is
    now created at proto_register time, and all protocols need to use proto_register,
    so its just a matter of switching the second parameter of proto_register to '1', heck,
    this can be done even at module load time with some small additional patch.
    
    Another optimization that will be possible in the future is to move the sk_protocol
    and sk_type struct sock members to struct proto, but this has to wait for all protocols
    to move completely to sk_prot.
    
    This changeset also introduces /proc/net/protocols, that lists the registered protocols
    details, some may seem excessive, but I'd like to keep them while working on further
    struct sock hierarchy work and also to realize which protocols are old ones, i.e. that
    still use struct proto_ops, etc, yeah, this is a bit of an exaggeration, as all protos
    still use struct proto_ops, but in time the idea is to move all to use sk->sk_prot and
    make the proto_ops infrastructure be shared among all protos, reducing one level of
    indirection.

    [SPARC64]: Handle non-8K PAGE_SIZE better in TLB miss handlers.
    
    The existing code mostly worked, but only for 32-bit
    processes.
    
    This caught a serious bug too, pgd_index() was masking
    with plain PTRS_PER_PGD instead of (PTRS_PER_PGD - 1).
    That has been with us for several years.  It is a wonder
    that things work at all some times :-)

    [PATCH] m68knommu: cleanup ColdFire specific trap handling asm code
    
    A couple of fixes to the ColdFire specific trap handling code:
    
    . do not clear the stack alignment bits in exception frame (in Lreturn)
      breaks return stack badly if applications work with stack un-aligned.
    . use generated asm-offsets instead of local offset definitions
    . use THREAD_SIZE definition instead of hard coding stack size
      (this is needed to support 4k stacks)
    . some instruction optimization (uses instructions that encode using
      ledd bytes)

    Fix two more ixp2000 typos, and place some comments in ixp2000-regs.h
    to remind the developer that the virtual addresses of some of the io

    [ARM PATCH] 2507/1: work around ixp2400 erratum #66
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    Intel's ixp2400 can occasionally corrupt writes to its on-chip
    registers, leading to system crashes.  The suggested workaround for
    this is to map in those registers using XCB=101 instead of XCB=000.
    Patch 2491/1 makes all mappings of ixp2000 on-chip I/O regions use
    section mappings.  This patch makes all iotable section mappings use
    XCB=101.  This patch depends on 2491/1.
    Kernel iotable mappings that are not 1MB-aligned, ioremap(), and
    userspace mappings using mmap() on /dev/mem will still generate
    XCB=000 mappings, which can trigger erratum #66 quite easily.
    For this, an extra patch (to arch/arm/mm/proc-xscale.S) is needed,
    which is maintained out-of-tree because it has been rejected in
    the past.  See http://ixp2xxx.sourceforge.net/kernel/ and look
    for 'ixp2000-erratum66-ptes.diff'.
    2.6.11-rc4 with 2491/1 plus this patch survives a week of heavy
    testing on my ENP-2611, while 2.6.11-rc4 vanilla doesn't stand a
    chance and crashes within 30 minutes under the same workload.

    [PATCH] ppc64: introduce pSeries_reconfig.[ch]
    
    Move as much pSeries-specific DLPAR/hotplug code as possible into its own
    file, which is built only when pSeries support is enabled in the config.  This
    new file is intended to contain support code for the "Dynamic Reconfiguration"
    option in the RISC Platform Architecture, which encompasses both PCI hotplug
    and dynamic logical partitioning (DLPAR).
    
    This patch mostly just moves code around, but the device node addition and
    removal API is slightly modified.  In this way, of_add_node and of_remove_node
    are now responsible only for safely updating the device tree and global list,
    without all the other stuff like proc entries etc.  of_add_node and
    of_remove_node have been renamed to of_attach_node and of_detach_node,
    respectively.
    
    This also adds the definitions and api for a notifier chain which is meant to
    be used by code that must act upon device node addition or removal.  Patches
    to migrate code to the notifier api follow in this series.

    [PATCH] ppc64: make OF node fixup code usable at runtime
    
    At boot we recurse through the device tree "fixing up" various fields and
    properties in the device nodes.  Long ago, to support DLPAR and hotplug, we
    largely duplicated some of this fixup code, the main data structures which are
    attached to the new device nodes.
    
    This patch introduces a helper function (prom_alloc) for handling allocations
    at both boot and runtime, kills most of the duplicated code, and makes
    finish_node, finish_node_interrupts, and interpret_pci_props suitable for use
    at runtime by converting them to use prom_alloc.

    [XFRM]: xfrm_policy destructor fix
    
    the patch below fixes a bug that i encountered while running a
    PREEMPT_RT kernel, but i believe it should be fixed in the generic
    kernel too. xfrm_policy_kill() queues a destroyed policy structure to
    the GC list, and unlocks the policy->lock spinlock _after_ that point.
    This created a scenario where GC processing got to the new structure
    first, and kfree()d it - then the write_unlock_bh() was done on the
    already kfreed structure. There is no guarantee that GC processing will
    be done after policy->lock has been dropped and softirq processing has
    been enabled.

    [PATCH] USB: ehci split ISO fixes (full speed audio etc)
    
    This contains patches to the EHCI driver for the full speed isochronous
    transfer support:
    
        - The sitd->hw_buf[1] and sitd->hw_buf_hi[1] fields were not
          correctly initialized, affecting transfers which crossed 4K
          boundaries.  Helps resolve some "buzz" in audio playback.
    
        - Correctly rounds 188-byte OUT transfers to fit into a single
          packet ... no split transfers needed.  Resolves other "buzz" in
          audio OUT streams.
    
        - Fixes a cut'n'paste error in the logic to check for microframe
          scheduling collisions with a given transaction translator.
          The error caused full speed iso tds to be treated in part as
          if they were high speed iso tds, which could oops.
    
        - The split transaction state flag doesn't indicate an error, and
          it should be ignored when deciding if (IN) transfers had errors.
    
        - Remove some code rejecting full speed iso IN transfers; it's
          not fully working yet though.
    
    Plus a some minor cleanups:  reporting the iso start frame in the
    relevant units, making a debug message more consistent.

    [PATCH] USB: pegasus uses netif_msg_*() filters
    
    This updates the messaging for the pegasus driver:
    
      - Use driver model diagnostics or printk using the interface name
        for all diagnostic messages ... not dbg()/warn()/err().
    
      - Almost everywhere, use the netif_msg_XXX() macros to check the
        message control bitmask maintained by ethtool.  The default mask
        is initialized using a new "message_level" module parameter.
    
    Also:
    
      - Removes the needless PEGASUS_RUNNING flag, replacing it with the
        standard netdevice mechanism.
    
      - Cleaner access for unaligned values.  Not all processors spend
        silicon to support them like x86 does.
    
      - Adds a few "sparse" fixes.
    
      - Saves the return values for the requests that manipulate chip
        registers ... doesn't yet check them, but at least anyone looking
        at the code (e.g. to find out why the link check task is wedged...)
        will see where those failure modes are ignored.  Currently the
        errors may be reported by printk, but the netif_msg_*() filters
        make that an even worse alert mechanism.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: remove RW_DETECT from being a config option
    
    This patch started life as as454b from Alan Stern.  It has been rediffed
    against the tip, including updates for the way unusual_devs flags are
    defined.
    
    This patch removes the Kconfig option USB_STORAGE_RW_DETECT.  That option
    was used to enable/supress the attempt to detect if a device was write
    protected.
    
    It seems that the vast majority of devices properly respond to the latest
    algorithm for making that determination.  So now we move to excluding only
    those devices that can't handle it.  We accomplish this via the
    unusual_devs.h list.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: combine waitqueues
    
    This patch started life as as476, and has been rediffed against the tip.
    However, that was a few days ago.
    
    This patch combines the two separate waitqueue heads used by the
    scsi-scanning thread and the device-reset routine into one.  After all,
    until the scanning thread is through waiting there will be no SCSI
    devices and hence no device resets.
    
    Once the scanning thread is done waiting, the waitqueue can be used by the
    reset logic -- so even if the act of scanning produces resets, we're fine.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: allow disconnect to complete faster
    
    This patch started life as as476 from Alan Stern.  It has been rediffed
    against the tip, tho that was a few days ago.
    
    This patch makes the disconnect() routine not wait for the control and
    scanning threads to exit.  This may not seem important now, but it will
    become important later: We would end up with a deadlock if disconnect()
    (which is called with the device locked) was waiting for the control
    thread to exit, while the control thread was waiting to lock the device so
    it could do an autosuspend.
    
    It's necessary to make sure that the host and us_data structures aren't
    deallocated before the control and scanning threads are through with them.
    This is done by calling scsi_host_get and scsi_host_put at the start and
    end of each thread, before signalling that the threads are running.  Since
    the probe() and disconnect() routines cannot run concurrently (guaranteed
    to us by the USB core), this method will guarantee the structures are not
    deallocated too soon.
    
    While there's nothing wrong with leaving the threads alive after
    disconnect() returns, there would be a real problem if the threads were
    still alive when usb_stor_exit returned!  So now usb_stor_exit has to wait
    to make sure all the threads have died.  Apparently the only safe way for
    one thread to signal another while exiting is to use complete_and_exit,
    which we've been doing.  So the patch adds a new driver-wide struct
    completion, named threads_gone, and each thread signals it while exiting.
    usb_stor_exit must call wait_for_completion the appropriate number of
    times, and that number is stored in a new counter named total_threads.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: exit control thread immediately upon disconnect
    
    This patch started life as as475 from Alan Stern.  It has been rediffed
    against the tip, tho that was several days ago.
    
    This patch causes the main control thread to exit as soon as possible,
    i.e., as soon as the DISCONNECTING flag is set.  It no longer waits for an
    explicit exit command, one with srb == NULL.
    
    There won't be any bad implications for our interaction with the SCSI
    midlayer, because once the DISCONNECTING flag is set we fail every
    submitted command immediately in the queuecommand routine.  And if a
    command manages to squeeze through the crack (submitted and accepted
    before we disconnect but not yet processed), the SCSI midlayer will cancel
    it automatically when we remove the host.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: make usb-storage structures refcounted by SCSI
    
    This patch started life as as474 from Alan Stern.  It's been rediffed
    against the tip, tho that is now several days old.
    
    This patch changes the way our private struct us_data is allocated; now it
    gets stored at the end of the Scsi_Host rather than separately.  That's
    what the hostdata field is intended for, and this is how other low-level
    host drivers operate.  In order to convert between us_data and the
    corresponding Scsi_Host I added two new inline routines: us_to_host and
    host_to_us.  (The conversion actually should be quicker than before by a
    microscopic amount, because now it only involves adding an offset whereas
    before it involved dereferencing a pointer.)
    
    The main advantage is that the host is refcounted, so now our us_data
    automatically is too.  Although that doesn't matter at the moment, it will
    matter later on when the control thread may need to outlive the disconnect
    callback.

    [PATCH] USB: pxa25x udc updates, mostly PM
    
    This has various updates to the PXA 21x/25x/26x UDC driver.
    
        - Implement the "new" pullup() and vbus_session() methods, and
          use them to keep the UDC 48 MHz clock off much of the time.
    
    	* Reworked that ugly Lubbock VBUS IRQ code.  Claim both IRQs,
    	  enable only one at a time; clock the UDC only when VBUS is
    	  present.  (And get rid of rude runtime messages.)
    
    	* Implement driver model suspend() and resume() calls.  When
    	  this device suspends, it clocks off the UDC.  On boards that
    	  support it (including Zaurus clamshells, but not Lubbock)
    	  the D+ pullup is disabled, so the host won't see the device.
    
        - Hmm, the "latest" errata defined some "Must Be One" bits.  OK.
    
        - Change the LED support for debugging.  It stopped compiling for
          Lubbock a while back.  This switches to the standard LED calls
          (so it can work on non-Lubbock hardware), removes the EP0 calls
          (not very useful any more), and for Lubbock now initializes the
          hex leds (U-Boot doesn't enable them, BLOB did).
    
        - "sparse" updates, and get rid of a warning that's pointless
          unless someone's working on DMA support;
    
    Tested on Lubbock (VBUS sensing but no pullup) and some Zaurus
    clamshells (pullup but no VBUS).

    Make Fusion-MPT much faster as module
    
    From: 	Moore, Eric Dean <Eric.Moore@lsil.com>
    
    Between the 3.01.16 and 3.01.18, we introduced new method
    to passing command line options to the driver.  Some of the
    command line options are used for fine tuning dv(domain
    validation) in the driver.  By accident, these command line options were
    wrapped around #ifdef MODULE in the 3.01.18 version of the driver.
    What this meant is when the driver is compiled built-in the kernel,
    the optimal settings for dv were ignored, thus poor performance.
    
    There was actually a fix for this when I submitted SAS drivers
    to the mailing list back in November, however the SAS drivers was
    rejected, and later on I overlooked submitting a single patch to
    solve this.

    [IPV4]: Clear DF bit in ip_fragment fast path
    
    It is possible for ip_fragment() to send out head fragments with
    both DF and MF set for packets with local_df set to true.  This is
    because the fast path tries to only modify the MF bit of the head
    fragment.
    
    Since the offset is always zero for the head fragment, and we know
    that DF should be cleared in case of local_df, we can change |= to
    a straight assignment.

    [IPV4]: Check mtu instead of frag_list in ip_push_pending_frames()
    
    I still didn't like the fact that ip_append_data was the only user
    of dst_pmtu :) So I went looking for bugs in the surrounding code.
    I managed to find something in ip_push_pending_frames.
    
    When dst_mtu < dst_pmtu - IPsec overhead (which can be caused by PMTU
    discovery within an IPsec tunnel), and we transmit a packet that's
    longer than dst_mtu but shorter than dst_pmtu - IPsec overhead, then
    the DF bit will be incorrectly set in the inner IP header.
    
    This will cause the packet to be dropped when it hits the router that
    generated the original PMTU event.  Unfortunately the ICMP packet coming
    back doesn't tell us anything new so the next time we send a packet we
    will do exactly the same thing.
    
    The fix is similar to what we did in ip_output.  Instead of checking
    whether frag_list is empty, we check the condition skb->len <= dst_mtu
    directly and set the DF bit based on that.
    
    We can enumerate all the possibilities to see that this is correct.
    
    If skb->len <= dst_mtu and frag_list is empty then this does the
    samething as before and is obviously correct.
    
    If skb->len <= dst_mtu and frag_list is non-empty then it implies
    that dst_pmtu has increased since the fragments were constructed
    as dst_pmtu = dst_mtu + IPsec overhead.  So the skb will now fit
    within a single fragment which means that setting DF is correct.
    The fragments will be merged by skb_linearise in dev_queue_xmit.
    
    If skb->len > dst_mtu and frag_list is non-empty then again this
    maintains the status quo.
    
    If skb->len > dst_mtu and frag_list is empty then we will leave the
    DF bit clear as the packet will need to be fragmented between the
    remote IPsec gateway and the final destination.

    This is needed so that we can keep the in_place assignment outside the

    having walk_out being different from walk_in, but when walk_out crosses

    [CRYPTO]: Kill obsolete iv check in cbc_process()
    
    Here's some more optimisations plus a bug fix for a pathological case
    where in_place might not be set correctly which can't happen with any
    of the current users.  Here is the first one:
    
    We have long since stopped using a null cit_iv as a means of doing null
    encryption.  In fact it doesn't work here anyway since we need to copy
    src into dst to achieve null encryption.
    
    No user of cbc_encrypt_iv/cbc_decrypt_iv does this either so let's just
    get rid of this check which is sitting in the fast path.

    This sets the stage for further optimisations down the track without
    polluting crypt() itself.
    
    These helpers don't belong in scatterwalk.[ch] since they only help
    the particular way that crypt() is walking the scatter lists.

    [CRYPTO]: Do scatterwalk_whichbuf inline.
    
    scatterwalk_whichbuf is called once for each block which could be as
    small as 8/16 bytes.  So it makes sense to do that work inline.
    
    It's also a bit inflexible since we may want to use the temporary buffer
    even if the block doesn't cross page boundaries.  In particular, we want
    to do that when the source and destination are the same.
    
    So let's replace it with scatterwalk_across_pages.
    
    I've also simplified the check in scatterwalk_across_pages.  It is
    sufficient to only check len_this_page.

    [PATCH] b44: allocate tx bounce bufs as needed
    
    From: "John W. Linville" <linville@tuxdriver.com>
    
    The b44 hardware has a DMA mask that only covers 1GB.  On x86, a DMA mask
    <4GB results in allocations using GFP_DMA.  The GFP_DMA pool (16MB) gets
    exhausted very quickly in some configurations.
    
    The b44 driver has been pre-allocating bounce buffers in a single large
    (~750k) contiguous block.  On boxes w/ limited GFP_DMA memory, this
    allocation can fail.  Such failure results in the driver being unable to
    load and function.
    
    The solution here is to check each tx skb against the DMA mask.  If it is
    outside the allowable range, a single buffer is allocated from the GFP_DMA
    range and discarded after the tx completes.  This behaviour mimics what is
    done for bounce buffers on the rx side.
    
    The pre-allocation of tx bounce buffers is, of course, removed.

    [PATCH] fix pci_disable_device in 8139too
    
    From: Andres Salomon <dilinger@debian.org>
    
    http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset@418391928THbmFKdJ5UCOhnFPMYbOA
    added an unconditional pci_disable_device() to __rtl8139_cleanup_dev().
    
    That's fine for rtl8139_remove_one and rtl8139_init_one; however, for
    rtl8139_init_board, it ends up being called in the error path.  That is, if
    pci_enable_device or pci_request_regions fails, err_out calls
    __rtl8139_cleanup_dev, which calls pci_disable_device.

    [TCP]: BIC not binary searching correctly
    
    While redoing BIC for the split up version, I discovered that the existing
    2.6.11 code doesn't really do binary search. It ends up being just a slightly
    modified version of Reno.  See attached graphs to see the effect over simulated
    1mbit environment.
    
    The problem is that BIC is supposed to reset the cwnd to the last loss value
    rather than ssthresh when loss is detected.  The correct code (from the BIC
    TCP code for Web100) is in this patch.

    Fix by Matt <matt@embeddedalley.com>:
    
    Some HDA codec nodes contain an amp, but do not provide local amp
    capabilities.  In these cases, AC_WCAP_AMP_OVRD is not set so we
    should query the AFG nid in order to get the general amp capabilities.

    [ALSA] rawmidi - move output trigger into a tasklet
    
    Documentation,RawMidi Midlevel
    Calling the output trigger callback from another interrupt handler
    can lead to unintuitive locking requirements (i.e., spin_lock_irqsave)
    in the sound card interrupt handler.  Moving the call to the callback
    into a tasklet cures this, and has the added benefit that the callback
    is called only once if more that one sequencer event has been
    delivered in one timer interrupt tick.

    [ALSA] fix P16V breakage for non Audigy2 cards
    
    EMU10K1/EMU10K2 driver
    The P16V patch unconditionally checks the IPR2 register in the interrupt
    handler resulting in infinite loop and system lockup on any non Audigy2
    cards.  I really hate checking emu->is_audigy and emu->revision in a
    fast path like the IRQ handler but I don't see another way.
    
    Also, don't bother allocating/freeing the DMA buffer for P16V unless
    it's really present.
    
    This is a critical fix and should trigger an immediate rc2 release IMO.
    Currently any emu10k1 users other than Audigy 2 will lock up hard as
    soon as they play any sound.

    [ARM PATCH] 2575/1: pass -mbig-endian/-mlittle-endian to invocations of cpp
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    We currently pass -mbig-endian/-mlittle-endian to the compiler and the
    assembler, but we do not pass it to cpp, even though it also needs it.
    So, add this flag to CPPFLAGS, and since CPPFLAGS is also passed to the
    compiler and the assembler, we can then then remove the flag from CFLAGS
    and AFLAGS.
    The symptom of this problem is the kernel hanging after
    "Memory: ......KB available (....K code, ...K data, ...K init)"
    when compiling a big-endian kernel with a little-endian toolchain or
    vice versa, and this happens because 'jiffies' points to the wrong
    half of 'jiffies_64' (due to vmlinux.lds having been generated with
    the wrong preprocessor flags), so calibrate_delay() takes forever to
    complete.
    Derived from an earlier patch by Krzysztof Halasa.

    [ARM PATCH] 2573/1: simplify align[bw]() in ixp2000's io.h and update comments
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    We currently have a workaround for the fact that early IXP2400s
    assert byte lanes for PCI I/O transactions the other way round.
    Newer silicon has a bit that can be set to 1 to get the 'proper'
    behavior, but since that is not available on older silicon we
    choose to keep working around this issue by hand.
    The workaround can be done in an easier way than is currently the
    case, though -- instead of substracting the lower two bits of the
    I/O address from 3 and putting the result back into the lower two
    bits, we can just toggle the two lowest bits using a simple XOR
    with 3.
    While we are at it, the outb() macro does not seem to parenthesize
    its first argument, while outw() and outl() do, so fix this up.

    [ARM PATCH] 2572/1: remove ifdefs from enp2611.c
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    If enp2611.c is compiled in, it implies that CONFIG_ARCH_ENP2611
    is defined, so we don't need the ifdefs.

    [ARM PATCH] 2571/1: minor time-keeping fixes for ixp2000
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    There are two very minor issues with time-keeping on the ixp2000:
    1. It turns out that if T#_CLD (timer reload value) is set to X,
       it means the timer will spend a full tick on 0, then a full
       tick on X, and then start counting down towards 0, which then
       effectively gives the timer a period of X+1 instead of the
       intended X.  Solve by writing X-1 instead of X to T#_CLD.
       This is relatively harmless, though -- assuming a 50MHz system
       clock (like on the ENP-2611) and HZ=100, there will be 500000
       timer interrupts generated per 500001 real-world jiffies, but
       that last timer interrupt will call timer_tick twice, taking the
       system time from 499999 jiffies plus 20000 usec to 500001 jiffies
       plus 0 usec.  Every 500000th jiffy will 'not exist', and every
       other jiffy will last 10002us instead of 10000us.
    2. next_jiffy_time is initialised as '0xffffffff - ticks_per_jiffy',
       but timer 4 starts ticking from 0xffffffff downwards, which will
       cause the time offset in the first 1/HZ sec after timer int init
       to be negative, and the first timer interrupt ever not to call
       timer_tick().
    Neither of these issues can cause clock drift or backwards clock
    motion, but it's good to fix them nevertheless.

    [SERIAL] 8250/sbc8560 bug/fix
    
    Patch from Amy Fong
    
    On the sbc8560 platform, changes were introduced as of 2.6.10-rc2
    which caused the sbc8560 to splutter noise all over the serial
    console.  It seems that ALPHA_KLUDGE_MCR was mulitply and differently
    defined in both drivers/serial/8250.h and include/linux/serialP.h
    
    Below is a patch that clones the definition of ALPHA_KLUDGE_MCR from
    serialP.h, it has been tested and works on the sbc8560.

    scsi1 : ncr53c8xx-3.4.3g

      Vendor: TOSHIBA   Model: CD-ROM XM-5401TA  Rev: 3605
      Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02

     target1:0:1: FAST-5 SCSI 4.2 MB/s ST (236 ns, offset 8)
     target1:0:1: Ending Domain Validation
    
    Although everything is fine.  The initial "target did not report SYNC"
    is because the driver is trying to negotiate over the initial inquiry
    (so, naturally we don't know if it supports sync yet).  The solution is
    to rip out the last remnants of the spontaneous attempts at negotiation
    to force it to wait for the DV negotiation in slave_configure.

    [PATCH] fix breakage in the SCSI generic tag code
    
    When I redid the target allocation routines, I inadvertently broke the
    generic tag code.  The problem is that the device is added to the host
    list after slave_configure in the new code.  This is too late since if
    any command disconnects during the initial inquiry phase, we now cannot
    find the device for the reconnect.  The fix is to add the device to the
    lists earlier.

    [PATCH] queue <-> sdev reference counting problem
    
    There is a problem with the way sdev is freed currently. The reason is
    really that there is a circular referencing problem: the sdev needs to
    hold on to the queue, but the queue (through the request function) also
    needs to hold on to the sdev.
    
    The easiest way to work-around this problem is to kill the sdev
    reference in the queue when the sdev is freed. On invocation of
    scsi_request_fn(), kill io to this device.

    [PATCH] Possible VIA-Rhine free irq issue
    
    It seems to me that in the VIA Rhine device driver the requested irq might
    not be freed in case the alloc_ring() function fails. alloc_ring()
    can fail with a ENOMEM return value because of possible
    pci_alloc_consistent() failures.
    
    Updated to CodingStyle.

    [PATCH] tasklist left locked
    
    On 4-way SMP, about one reboot in twenty hangs while killing processes:
    exit needs exclusive tasklist_lock, but something still holds read_lock.
    do_signal_stop race case misses unlock, and fixing it fixes the symptom.

    [PATCH] : Fix check for underflow
    
    http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4279
    Summary: When I try to start vpnc the net/core/skbuff.c:91 crash
    
    This check is wrong, gcc optimizes it away:
    
                    if ((len -= sizeof(pi)) > len)
    			return -EINVAL;
    
    This could be responsible for the BUG. If len is 2 or 3 and TUN_NO_PI
    isn't set it underflows. alloc_skb() allocates len + 2, which is 0 or
    1 byte. skb_reserve tries to reserve 2 bytes and things explode in
    skb_put.

    return IPSEC objects which are in the XFRM_STATE_ACQ

    [PATCH] Possible AMD8111e free irq issue
    
    It seems to me that if in the amd8111e_open() fuction dev->irq isn't
    zero and the irq request succeeds it might not get released anymore.
    
    Specifically, on failure of the amd8111e_restart() call the function
    returns -ENOMEM without releasing the irq. The amd8111e_restart()
    function can fail because of various pci_alloc_consistent() and
    dev_alloc_skb() calls in amd8111e_init_ring() which is being
    called by amd8111e_restart.
    
    1374     if(dev->irq ==0 || request_irq(dev->irq, amd8111e_interrupt, SA_SHIRQ,
    1375                      dev->name, dev))

    A gentoo user with completely different hardware also ran into this:

    2.6.11-mm3 fixes this problem and I've identified the specific fix, which is
    already in the ALSA development tree. An ALSA developer asked me to submit the
    fix for 2.6.11.x when I'd found it, so here it is :)

    with the actual layout in Linux.  Linux doesn't put a hole in the middle

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix error cases in nvram partition scan
    
    The NVRAM on pSeries machines and powermacs is structured as a series of
    partitions, each of which has a header containing its length (including the
    header) and a header checksum.  When the checksum was wrong or the length
    was zero, we would previously keep trying to scan through the partitions,
    possibly looping forever if the length was zero.  This patch changes the
    behaviour to terminate the scan when a corrupted partition is found.

    [PATCH] ppc64: make cpu hotplug play well with maxcpus and smt-enabled
    
    This patch allows you to boot a pSeries system with maxcpus=x or
    smt-enabled=off (or both) and bring up the offline cpus later from userspace,
    assuming the kernel was built with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y.
    
    - Record cpus which were started from OF in a cpu map and use that instead
      of system_state to decide how to start a cpu in smp_startup_cpu.
    
    - Change the smp bootup logic slightly so that the path for bringing up
      secondary threads is exactly the same as hotplugging a cpu later from
      userspace.
    
    - Add a new function to smp_ops - cpu_bootable.  This is implemented only by
      pSeries to filter out secondary threads during boot with smt-enabled=off.
      Another way this could be done is to change the kick_cpu member to return
      int and we can check for this case in smp_pSeries_kick_cpu.
    
    - Remove the games we play with cpu_present_map and the
      hard_smp_processor_id to handle smt-enabled=off, since they're now
      unnecessary.
    
    - Remove find_physical_cpu_to_start; assigning threads to logical slots
      should be done at bootup and at DLPAR time, not during a cpu online
      operation.
    
    One caveat: you need up-to-date firmware on Power5 for the maxcpus option to
    work on systems with more than one processor.  Otherwise interrupts get
    misrouted, typically resulting in hangs or "unable to find root filesystem"
    problems.
    
    Tested on Power5 with and without CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU and with various
    combinations of the maxcpus= and smt-enabled= parameters.

    on pSeries LPAR.  This is the "right" way to do it, as opposed to setting
    cpu_present_map = cpu_possible_map at boot (this is fixed in a following
    patch).

    [PATCH] ppc64: missing newline/carrige return in zImage
    
    Some eyecandy for zImage and zImage.initrd.
    
    Most OF implementations do not print a newline after their last line of
    output, so the "zImage starting..." appears right after the last number or
    netboot output.
    
    A zImage.initrd misses a carrige return to avoid a staircase effect.
    
    Tested on JS20.

    [PATCH] ppc64 iSeries: cleanup viopath
    
    I figured I might as well do some simple cleanups.  This patch does:
    
    - single bit int bitfields are a bit suspect and Anndrew pointed out
      recently that they are probably slower to access than ints
    
    - get rid of some more studly caps
    
    - define the semaphore and the atomic in struct alloc_parms rather than
      pointers to them since we just allocate them on the stack anyway.
    
    - one small white space cleanup
    
    - use the HvLpIndexInvalid constant instead of ita value
    
    Built and booted on iSeries (which is the only place it is used).

    RTAS is not actually pSeries specific, but some PPC64 code that relies on RTAS

    This introduces a generic configuration option PPC_RTAS that can be used by

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix kprobes calling smp_processor_id when preemptible
    
    When booting with kprobes and preemption both enabled and
    CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y, I get lots of warnings about smp_processor_id being
    called in preemptible code, from kprobe_exceptions_notify.  On ppc64,
    interrupts and preemption are not disabled in the handlers for most
    synchronous exceptions such as breakpoints and page faults (interrupts are
    disabled in the very early exception entry code but are reenabled before
    calling the C handler).
    
    This patch adds a preempt_disable/enable pair to kprobe_exceptions_notify,
    and moves the preempt_disable() in kprobe_handler() to be done only in the
    case where we are about to single-step an instruction.  This eliminates the
    bug warnings.
    
    From: Ananth N Mavinakayanahalli <ananth@in.ibm.com>
    
    The patch is fine, but it seems to break jprobes - we have an unbalanced
    preempt_enable/disable path while handling jprobes. Patch below is
    against 2.6.11-mm4 and fixes the issue.

    [PATCH] ppc32: add support for Sky Computers HDPU Compute blade enhanced features
    
    The Sky Computers HDPU compute blade is an embedded compute platform for
    the Sky Computers SMARTpac 600/1200 series.  The blade consists of
    ppc7445/ppc7447A UP or SMP, Marvell Discovery II, 100 BaseT ethernet, a
    single PCI/PCI-X slot, and a PCI-X on-board Infiniband device.
    
    This patch contains drivers for enhanced features of the HDPU compute
    blade.  Namely, 2 drivers for registers used by the Health monitoring
    co-processor.  The cpustate register is a write only register used to
    convey critical states to the health monitor and the nexus registers
    provides a read-only interface from the health monitoring system to provide
    location based information.

    [ aside: This has been sitting in the linuxppc-2.5 bk tree for I don't
      know how long.  And the driver is still horribly broken. ]
    
    The following patch moves overlay_is_active to before its first use.  It
    was originally written when gcc wouldn't complain, but now does, about not
    having the definition before usage.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Add virtual DMA support to legacy floppy driver
    
    This patch adds support for pseudo-dma transfers on ppc32 for the legacy
    floppy driver.  It is useful on some machines like pegasos where the legacy
    DMA doesn't seem to work properly (possibly to the lack of a "legacy" DMA zone
    on ppc32).

    This patch fixes the cpufreq support for newer machines, including latest
    Apple laptops using the 7447A CPU.  With this patch, it should now
    propertly detect that the CPU is booting low speed on some models, and let

    frequency of the full speed CPU but it was really running low speed).

    This would have been the patch that removed dst->path.  But

    However, using dst->path is only needed rarely and should always

    and dst_path_metric and use dst_mtu and dst_metric directly.

    [IPSEC]: Get ttl from child instead of path
    
    Now that dst_pmtu is almost gone let's do the same to dst_path_metric.
    I've only found one legitimate use of it and that's the one that was
    recently added in dst_allfrag.
    
    This patch makes xfrm4_encap/xfrm6_encap use dst->child instead of
    dst->path so that we choose the correct route to get the hoplimit
    from when nested tunnels are present.
    
    For simple tunnels dst->child == dst->path so there is no change.

    [IPV4]: Kill remaining unnecessary uses of dst_pmtu
    
    Once again here is a couple of trivial dst_pmtu/dst_mtu replacements.
    In both locations, we can only have simple dst entries which means
    that dst == dst->path.
    
    BTW, this is the rule that we should apply in future for uses of
    dst_mtu/dst_pmtu (or other metrics on dst).  If the only dst's that
    can appear are simple dst's (dst == dst->path), then we should use
    dst_mtu or dst_metric.  If dst != dst->path, then whoever is writing
    the code will need to think about which of dst or dst->path is the
    right one.
    
    In most instances dst will be the one.  However, as we have seen in
    ip_append_data, dst->path may be needed rarely.  In particular, if
    we're doing fragmentation immediately after IPsec, then you may need
    it.

    [NETFILTER]: Use correct IPSEC MTU in TCPMSS
    
    This patch makes ipt_TCPMSS use the correct MTU value for clamping.
    This is a bit tricky actually since TCPMSS can be used in FORWARD,
    LOCAL_OUT as well as POST_ROUTING.
    
    In the first two cases we haven't performed IPsec yet so dst_mtu
    obviously does the right thing.  As it is, POST_ROUTING is performed
    after xfrm_output so MSS clamping is useless there.
    
    With Patrick's IPsec netfilter stuff, there will be a POST_ROUTING
    processing before IPsec processing, in which case dst_mtu also returns
    exactly what we want.

    [IPV4]: Fix MTU check in ipmr_queue_xmit
    
    Somehow I missed four files with dst_pmtu usages in them.  I'm going
    to split them along the sames lines I did before: bug fixes and then
    the trivial changes.
    
    Here is a patch that replaces dst_pmtu with dst_pmtu in ipmr.c
    since this is straight IPIP tunneling equivalent to what we have
    in ipip.c.
    
    As it is we may send ICMP packets when IPsec is present which is
    exactly what the comment says that we shouldn't do.

    [PATCH] m68k-nommu: remove vendor/board specific startup code
    
    Remove all board specific startup code files. Code has been merged
    into a much smaller set of common code for each CPU class type,
    so that is 3 types now.

    [PATCH] m68k-nommu: move PILOT platform startup code
    
    Create more common 68328 startup code for the PILOT platform.
    It requires some unique setup from boot, that no other platform
    requires. This is part of the re-organization of the start up
    code to make more if it common.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: change how unusual_devs.h flags are defined
    
    This patch started life as as473 from Alan Stern, and has been rediffed
    against the current tip.
    
    This patch changes the way the flags bits are defined, so that the
    proc_info routine can automatically list all the flags that are set.  As a
    side effect it will also include the NEED_OVERRIDE flag; that shouldn't
    really matter.  (As another side effect, the definitions grew too long to
    fit on a single 80-character line so I had to wrap the comments.)
    
    This patch also takes the opportunity to remove a couple of obsolete flags
    and to renumber the bit values.  The patch also removes an unusual_devs
    entry whose only purpose was to set one of those obsolete flags; apparently
    it got left behind when all the other uses of those flags were removed.

    g_file_storage driver (just to spiff it up and help in testing software
    that looks at those strings).  It also enlarges the space reserved for the
    Manufacturer string, since combinations of long kernel names and long UDC
    driver names were sometimes getting truncated.

    [PATCH] USB: ethernet/rndis gadget driver updates
    
    Various fixes to the Ethernet/RNDIS gadget core code:
    
        - Pre-allocate the request used to transfer status back to the host.
          Used initially for CDC Ethernet; RNDIS will change later.  This
          resolves a longstanding FIXME, elimininating fault modes.
    
        - Use larger packets for those status reports, 16 bytes not 8; this
          eliminates some fault modes, without losing hardware support.
    
        - Streamline endpoint configuration, just save the endpoints during
          driver binding.  The previous scheme was a complex leftover from
          before the endpoint autoselection library code existed, and this
          bit of cleanup prepares for more simplifications later.
    
        - Implement a basic outgoing packet filter, for CDC Ethernet and RNDIS
          but not the CDC subset.  This improves conformance to both specs.
    
        - Correct the bit rate reports for CDC Ethernet and RNDIS to match
          the peak bulk transfer rates, not the raw signaling rates.
    
    This still doesn't issue CDC or RNDIS link status change notifications
    to the host as often as it should, but that'll be easier now.

    [PATCH] USB: usbnet fix for Zaurus C-860
    
    This patch resolves a recent problem with the Zaurus C-860 support.
    
    A change to correct handling of Zaurii that are lying about their support
    for the "CDC Ethernet" class specification broke the C-860, which tells
    an entirely different lie (that it supports "CDC MDLM", providing access
    to a cell phone modem).  The code expecting it to be telling a lie about
    CDC Ethernet support naturally misbehaved.  (Sharp should straighten out
    its story.  The 2.6 OpenZaurus kernels don't have any such issues...)
    
    The fix is just to recognize this bogus MDLM stuff and ignore it.
    This patch also includes the two MDLM descriptors in <linux/usb_cdc.h>
    although they're not currently used.

    [PATCH] USB: ehci and short in-bulk transfers with 20KB+ urbs
    
    This changes handling of short bulk IN transfers with URB buffers that require
    two or more transfer descriptors.  The case is rare in most systems, since few
    drivers use such large buffers (bigger than 20KB, assuming 4K-aligned).
    
    The existing code misbehave on at least NEC's EHCI 0.95 silicon, where it seems
    to hit a new variant of a silicon quirk relating to dummy TDs.  Symptom of the
    misbehavior is that the host stops polling on the IN endpoint, and the URB queue
    no longer progresses.
    
    This fix uses simpler logic to detect those short reads, dodging that quirk.

    [PATCH] USB: ohci zero length control IN transfers
    
    This fixes a longstanding bug in the OHCI driver, inherited from the 2.4
    code.  It also fixes a related comment in the EHCI driver, which came when
    the EHCI code was first derived from OHCI.  (The EHCI code doesn't have
    that bug; the comment was effectively "FIXME add bug".)
    
    The bug: control-IN transfers with no data stages have status stages with
    an IN packet (like a control-OUT transfer), instead of using an OUT packet.
    See figure 8-37 of the USB spec.  The current code makes trouble with some
    peripheral hardware and zero length IN transfers (scarce in the Real World).

     - The "dummy_hcd" moves to the end, with a comment to please
       keep it there.

    the ROM's PCI config space.  IORESOURCE_ROM_ENABLE is for tracking the
    IORESOURCE that the ROM is enabled.  Both are defined to 1 so code
    shouldn't change.
    
    Just to remind people, there are new PCI routines for enable/disable ROMs
    so please call them instead of directly coding access in device drivers.
    There are ten or so drivers that need to be converted to the new API.

    [ARCH]: Consolidate portable unaligned.h implementations.
    
    Several architectures do their asm/unaligned.h support support by
    simply casting the pointer to a packed strcuture, then deref'ing that
    pointer.  This forces gcc to assume the object is not aligned
    properly.
    
    This technique originated in Richard Henderson's
    asm-alpha/unaligned.h, IA64 uses the same technique as well.
    
    This works well on RISC systems for two reasons:
    
    1) On systems like Alpha, MIPS, et al. which have special
       "load unaligned" instructions, GCC knows to emit them
       for code like this.
    
    2) Even on systems without explicit unaligned load/store instruction
       support, the code emitted (basically, byte loads with shifts and
       ors) is about the same as what you get when emitting a memmove()
       call and you don't need the local stack slot.
    
    I was going to thus move asm-sparc64/unaligned.h over to such a
    scheme, but then I noticed that nobody actually includes the current
    memmove() based asm-generic/unaligned.h code.  So why not put the
    portable packed structure implementation into asm-generic/unaligned.h
    and then make asm-{alpha,ia64,sparc64}/unaligned.h simply include that?
    
    I only had to make minor modifications to the alpha header when placing
    it into the generic area.  In particular I had to convert some explicit
    "unsigned long", "unsigned int" et al. into the arch-agnostic "u64" "u32"
    etc.  so that even 32-bit platforms could use this.
    
    Come to think of it I'll make sparc32 use this as well.
    
    I looked at all the other platform unaligned.h headers:
    
    I386/X86_64: can do unaligned loads directly
    ARM: is trying to be incredibly clever, and open codes the shifts and
         ors.  I think it would be better if it used something similar to
         the packed structure technique.
    CRIS: like x86, can do unaligned stuff directly.
    FRV: needs help doing unaligned stuff, it probably also could use the
         packed structure stuff.
    H8300: needs help, could use this new asm-generic/unaligned.h header
    M32R: likewise
    M68K: can do unaligned access directly.
    MIPS: appears to be a copy of the original alpha/ia64 unaligned.h
          header, so I converted it to use the new asm-generic/unaligned.h
          too
    PARISC: is just a copy of asm-sparc/unaligned.h, so I converted it
            over to use asm-generic/unaligned.h too
    PPC/PPC64: can do unaligned access directly in big-endian mode which
               is what the Linux kernel runs in
    S390: can do it directly as well
    SH/SH64: just has the memmove() code ala asm-sparc/unaligned.h, I
             converted it to use asm-generic/unaligned.h
    V850: has some clever code just like ARM, so I didn't touch it.
    
    So this is the patch I came up with.

    [PATCH] PPC64 Implement non-executable stacks
    
    This patch, by Jake Moilanen with some further hacking from me, adds a
    real execute permission bit to the linux PTEs on PPC64, and connects
    that into the kernel infrastructure for implementing non-executable
    stacks and heaps.  This means that on any PPC64 cpu since the POWER4
    (i.e. POWER4, PPC970, PPC970FX, POWER4+, POWER5) you will get a
    segfault if you try to execute instructions from a region that doesn't
    have PROT_EXEC permission.  The patch also marks the pages of the
    linear mapping that aren't part of the kernel text as non-executable.
    
    Andrew and Linus, could you try this on your G5s?  I have tried it
    here on a Debian system and a SLES9 system and everything runs fine,
    but I haven't been able to try it on YDL, FC or RHEL4.
    
    With this patch we default to executable stack and read-implies-exec
    behaviour when there is no PT_GNU_STACK program header entry, or when
    there is one and it indicates the stack is executable.  For 32-bit
    processes, the heap is always executable, because the PLT contains
    instructions and it ends up in the bss segment.

    umount: avoid racy block-size set
    
    Setting the block size back to the original blocksize at umount time
    is unnecessary, and can cause buffer errors and infinite loops in
    __getblk_slow, and possibly other problems.
    
    Just getting bdev_lock instead causes other issues, namely AB-BA deadlocks
    with /proc/meminfo etc. Just drop it, and replace with a "sync_blockdev()"
    to cause a flush (which was a side effect of changing the blocksize before).

    [IPV4]: Make ipt_REJECT use icmp_send again.
    
    As it is ipt_REJECT doesn't work at all with IPsec.  Despite my efforts
    previously in making the policy lookups work there I neglected to change
    the final call to dst_output so the policy lookup is useless.
    
    ipt_REJECT also had a number of deviations from icmp_send which seems to
    be unjustified.  For examples it ignored source routing IP options.
    
    There was a bug in icmp_send too :) It didn't set the ICMP type/code
    values for the policy lookup.

    [TCP]: Use get_unaligned() in tcp_parse_options()
    
    TCP options are not guaranteed to be aligned at all, so we should use
    get_unaligned when accessing u16- or u32-values in the TCP
    options header to avoid alignment errors on some platforms. The patch
    applies to vanilla 2.6.11.

    [IPSEC]: Revert ip{,6}_append_data() dst_mtu() conversion.
    
    This patch is wrong.  This is the *one* place where we do need to
    use the path MTU.  The reason is that when the packet is fragmented
    we only pay for the IPsec overhead once over all and not once for
    each fragment.
    
    Please revert it for now.
    
    The trailer_len in ip_append_data is not quite right as the trailer's
    length depends on the length of the entire packet.  However, it should
    be harmless since ESP knows how to extend the packet when necessary.

    Every user region has a hole in the middle where we don't have

    [PATCH] gcc4 fix for sn_serial.c
    
    The sal_console and sal_console_uart structures have a circular
    relationship since they both initialize member fields to pointers of one
    another.  The current code forward declares sal_console_uart as extern so
    that sal_console can take its address, but gcc4 complains about this since
    the real definition of sal_console_uart is marked 'static'.  This patch
    just removes the static qualifier from sal_console_uart to avoid the
    inconsistency.

    FC Remote Port Patch
    
    This is the reworked patch for fc_remote ports.
    It started with the "patch2" converted for scsi-misc-2.6 (and
    updated for the revised midlayer scsi target implementation)
    Incorporates Andrew Vasquez's updates
    Adds scsi target scanning on behalf of the driver based on
    addition of a per-host workq.
    
    This patch adds support for FC Remote Ports (which may or may not
    be FCP targets) to the fc transport. The attributes for the ports are
    in support of HBAAPI. This patch also implements consistent scsi target
    id bindings for the remote ports.
    
    This patch also moves the dev_loss attribute from the target-level
    fc_transport device to the remote port device. It also deletes the
    link_down attribute. The fc_target_block and fc_target_unblock
    routines have been replaced by fc_remote_port_block and
    fc_remote_port_unblock. The fc_host_block/unblock functions have
    been removed (unused).
    
    A new interface has been created - fc_remove_host(), which a driver
    must call immediately prior to scsi_remove_host() when unloading.
    This tears down the transport, starget, and sdev devices.
    The transport, which utilizes the midlayer mods to insert transport
    entities between the shost and starget, results in a device tree
    such as the following:
    
      /sys/class/fc_host/host4/device/rport-4:0-0/target4:0:0/4:0:0:0

    [PATCH] SCSI tape security: require CAP_ADMIN for SG_IO etc.
    
    The kernel currently allows any user permitted to access the tape device file
    to send the tape drive commands that may either make the tape drivers internal
    state inconsistent or to change the drive parameters so that other users find
    the drive to be unusable. This patch changes ioctl handling so that SG_IO,
    SCSI_IOCTL_COMMAND, etc. require CAP_ADMIN. This solves the consistency
    problems for SCSI tapes. The st driver provides user-accessible commands to
    change the drive parameters that users may need to access.
    
    The SCSI command permissions were discussed widely on the linux lists but this
    did not result in any useful refinement of the permissions. It may very well
    be that the tape drives are the only devices that users are sometimes given
    permissions to access and that have security problems with the current command
    filtering. This patch solves the problem for tapes and no more elaborate
    patches are needed.

    [IPV4/IPV6]: Fix IPsec calculation in ip_append_data/ip6_append_data
    
    This patch fixes the IPsec overhead handling in ip_append_data and
    ip6_append_data.  As it is they assume that the IPsec overhead is
    constant.  This is not true as with ESP the IPsec overhead will vary
    as the MTU varies.
    
    The result is that they may produce packets that will exceed the MTU
    when ESP is used.  Had it taken the trailer_len into account, it would
    have produced packets less than the real MTU.
    
    By switching to dst_mtu we get the optimal result.

    [ARM PATCH] 2537/2: S3C2410 - fix iomem warnings from sparse
    
    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    Change all S3C24XX_VA defines to have the type `void __iomem *`
    and the necessary changes to the other bits of the s3c24xx
    support.
    Note, the map_desc will need changing in the future to allow
    `void __iomem *` instead of an unsigned long for IO

    [NETLINK]: Fix multicast bind/autobind race
    
    netlink_autobind has always set nlk_sk(sk)->groups to zero.  This is
    unnecessary because sk_alloc already zeroes the entire structure.
    Since a socket can only be bound once netlink_autobind doesn't need
    to zero groups at all.
    
    This had been safe until I added mc_list.  Now it is possible for
    netlink_bind to race against netlink_autobind running on the same
    socket on another CPU.  The result would be a socket that's on
    mc_list with groups set to zero.  This socket will be left on the
    list even after it is destroyed.
    
    The fix is to remove the zeroing in netlink_autobind.

    I'm now cleaning up all users of dst_pmtu with the aim of replacing
    dst_pmtu with dst_mtu.  I'm going to start with the ones that actually

    This patch fixes the length calculation in icmp_send.  As it is
    we're overestimating the space available by including the space
    that would be used up by IPsec encapsulation.
    
    IPv6 doesn't have this problem since its calculation is based
    on 1280 instead of the PMTU.

    Since the ipr adapter initialization is performed by waiting for

    from the adapter, and the timeout for this interrupt is 5 minutes,
    failed ipr adapters can halt the boot process for a long time.
    In certain environments, it makes sense to not try as hard to get
    the adapter working and just fail the adapter. This patch adds

    [PATCH] ipr: Device remove cleanup
    
    If a device disappears across an adapter reset, ipr schedules the device to be
    removed from scsi core. Any ops sent to that device prior to its actual removal
    end up getting sent to the adapter using a now invalid adapter resource handle.
    Usually, the adapter will just fail the command and the failure will end up
    looking like a selection timeout, but it is possible the resource handle
    has been re-used by the adapter and we could be sending an op to a different
    device than we think we are. This patch closes this window.

    [PATCH] ftape/fdc-io: insert set_current_state() before schedule_timeout()
    
    Inserts a set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) before the schedule_timeout()
    call.  Without this change, after the first iteration of the loop,
    schedule_timeout() will not only return immediately, but the loop will break,
    as the conditional will no longer be satisfied.  In fact, this conditional
    makes little sense given the workings of schedule_timeout.  The timeout
    variable is ignored, as well, and I'm fairly certain that it should be
    included in the loop conditional.  That way, if the timeout expires before a
    signal hits, -ETIME will be returned by fdc_interrupt_wait() instead of
    -EINTR.

    [PATCH] procfs: fix printk arg type warning
    
    On sparc32 build, there is a printk format arg-type warning:
    fs/proc/proc_misc.c:195: warning: long unsigned int format, unsigned int arg (arg 23)
    
    I tried to fix it with a change to asm-sparc/vaddrs.h:
    -#define VMALLOC_START          0xfe600000
    +#define VMALLOC_START          0xfe600000UL
    -#define VMALLOC_END            0xffc00000
    +#define VMALLOC_END            0xffc00000UL
    
    but that won't fly because the #defines are used in asm code and asm doesn't
    like the UL suffixes (reported by Bill Irwin).

    [PATCH] mark BLK_DEV_PS2 as BROKEN
    
    Andries Brouwer proposed this patch with the following comment:
    
    As observed earlier, ps2esdi was broken as a module, and the passing of
    geometry boot parameters is broken.  But does it still work with kernels
    2.3 or later?  I think it does, but failed to verify that.
    
    I found an IBM PS/2 model 70-A21 with 8 MB and 120 MB ESDI disk.
    Tried a few distribution boot floppies to see whether they would boot.
    
    Slackware has special ibmmca bootdisks.
    SW 3.3 - Linux 2.1.43 - boots fine
    SW 4.0 - Linux 2.2.6 - hangs
    SW 7.0 - Linux 2.2.13 - boots fine
    SW 8.1 - Linux 2.4.18 - boots, but every single command is killed by OOM
    SW 10.0 - Linux 2.4.26 - kernel panic: no 386 supported
    
    Then Debian:
    Woody - Linux 2.2.10 - boots fine, but the rootdisk hangs
    Sarge - Linux 2.4.27 - does not recognize the ESDI disk, and the rootdisk
     crashes by OOM.
    
    So, good luck with 2.1 and 2.2 kernels, only failures with later kernels.
    
    What about other people? The two major Linux/MCA sites were
    http://glycerine.itsmm.uni.edu/mca (also referenced in Documentation/mca.txt)
    but it doesnt exist any longer, and http://www.dgmicro.com/mca/,
    which still exists ("last update: Jan 28 1999"), but the binaries
    it refers to live on ftp.dgmicro.com, which isn't there anymore.
    
    Concerning the speed:
    I measured this ESDI disk under Linux as transferring 50 kB/s,
    that is 4% of the speed the IBM specs claim. Also other Linux users
    complained that the disk is much faster under DOS.
    
    My proposal for this patch would be to get it into one 2.6 kernel (is it
    too late for 2.6.11?) and wait if anyone was still using it and screams,
    and remove it a few months later otherwise.

    [PATCH] smp{,boot}.c cleanups
    
    This patch contains the following cleanups on several architectures:
    - make some needlessly global code static
    - remove the following write-only (except for printk's) variables:
      - cache_decay_ticks
      - smp_threads_ready
      - cacheflush_time
    
    I've only tried the compilation on i386, but I hope all mistakes I made
    are on unimportant architectures.  ;-)

    [PATCH] prism54: misc cleanups
    
    This patch makes some functions in prism54 that are only required
    locally static.
    
    As a side effect it turned out that the mgt_unlatch_all function was
    completely unused, and it's therefore #if 0'ed.
    
    I also considered moving display_buffer as static inline into
    islpci_mgt.h, but I wasn't 100% sure and therefore left it.

    [PATCH] remove bouncing email address of Hennus Bergman
    
    The email address of Hennus Bergman in the kernel is bouncing.
    
    Aftern asking him whether I should update his email address in the Linux
    kernel, he replied:
    
    <--  snip  -->
    
    I get a lot of spam already and I'd rather avoid getting even more by
    'advertising' my email address on the internet like that. So I don't want
    my current email address in the kernel distribution.
    If you want to remove my old cybercomm.nl email address, that's fine
    by me.
    
    <--  snip  -->
    
    This patch therefore simply his bouncing email address and no longer

    [PATCH] Make loglevels in init/main.c a little more sane.
    
    This patch modifies a few of the printk() loglevels used in init/main.c in
    an attempt to make them a bit more appropriate.
    
    The default loglevel is KERN_WARNING, but a few printk's without explicit
    loglevel are not (in my oppinion) warnings, so add proper warning levels -
    for instance; telling the user how many CPU's were brought up is hardly a
    warning, make it KERN_INFO instead.  The initial printing of linux_banner
    is not a warning condition, I'd say it's more of a NOTICE or even INFO
    condition - I've made it KERN_NOTICE just as the printing of the kernel
    command line.  A few printk's without explicit loglevel do match the
    default one, but I've made them explicit (the default could change in the
    future, and if it does then explicitly setting the proper loglevel is a
    nice thing).

    True, that's not how most people build, but some of us do in order to try and
    find potential trouble spots, and the less warnings we have to go through the
    better - especially when they can be cleaned up nice and safe with no real
    impact to the code like these ones.  Please apply.

    [PATCH] arch/sparc/kernel/ptrace: pointless assignment and shadowed var
    
    A few tiny cleanups for arch/sparc/kernel/ptrace.c::do_ptrace post the big
    verify_area/access_ok cleanup.
    
    'ret' shadows a variable of the same name in the enclosing scope, rename it.
    
    The assignment of -EFAULT to 'i' exactely mirrors what the old verify_area
    code did, but that was only to use 'i' to check the return value of
    verify_area.  Now that we check access_ok directly and 'i' is initialized in
    the for loop a few lines below anyway, the asignment of -EFAULT to i is bogus,
    just pass pass EFAULT directly as the second arg to pt_error_return.
    
    Also a few tiny whitespace cleanups - 'if ()' vs 'if()'.

    [PATCH] verify_area cleanup : deprecate
    
    The previous 9 patches should take care of converting all callers of
    verify_area into access_ok, so now it's time to deprecate verify_area all over
    so noone gets tempted to use it in new code - this patch does that.
    
    Eventually when this has been deprecated for a while I'll send patches to
    completely remove the function (thoughts on how long it should be deprecated
    first are welcome).

    [PATCH] swsusp: enable resume from initrd
    
    From: <mjg59@scrf.ucam.org>
    
    When using a fully modularized kernel it is necessary to activate resume
    manually as the device node might not be available during kernel init.
    
    This patch implements a new sysfs attribute '/sys/power/resume' which allows
    for manual activation of software resume.  When read from it prints the
    configured resume device in 'major:minor' format.  When written to it expects
    a device in 'major:minor' format.  This device is then checked for a suspended
    image and resume is started if a valid image is found.  The original
    functionality is left in place.
    
    It should be used from initramfs, or with care.

    [PATCH] swsusp: use non-contiguous memory on resume
    
    The following patch is designed to fix a problem in the current implementation
    of swsusp in mainline kernels.  Namely, swsusp uses an array of page backup
    entries (aka pagedir) to store pointers to memory pages that must be saved
    during suspend and restored during resume.
    
    Unfortunately, the pagedir has to be located in a contiguous chunk of memory
    and it sometimes turns out that an 8-order or even 9-order allocation is
    needed for this purpose.  It sometimes is impossible to get such an allocation
    and swsusp may fail during either suspend or resume due to the lack of memory,
    although theoretically there is enough free memory for it to succeed.
    
    Moreover, swsusp is more likely to fail for this reason during resume, which
    means that it may fail during resume after a successful suspend (this actually
    has happened for some people, including me :-)) and this, potentially, may
    lead to the loss of data.
    
    The problem is fixed by replacing the pagedir with a linklist so that
    high-order memory allocations are avoided (the patches make swsusp use only
    0-order allocations).  Unfortunately this means that it's necessary to change
    assembly routines used to restore the image after it's been loaded from swap
    so that they walk the list instead of walking the array.
    
    This patch makes swsusp allocate only individual pages during resume.  it
    contains the necessary changes to the assembly routines etc.  for i386 and
    x86-64.

    [PATCH] ppc64: NUMA memory fixup
    
    When I booted my new 720 on a kernel configured for NUMA, I received
    the following during bootup:
    
    WARNING: Unexpected node layout: region start 44000000 length 2000000
    NUMA is disabled
    
    This is due to memory 'holes' within nodes.  If such holes are
    encountered, then NUMA is disabled.  The following patch adds support
    for such configurations.
    
    This patch gets the cell sizes before extracting the cells.  I have made this
    change to existing code in the file, as well as the code I added.

    [PATCH] Unbacked shared memory not included in ELF core dump
    
    We're currently not including sysv shared memory segments in coredumps.
    
    This patch intends to include any shared mapping whose target file has zero
    links.  That covers sysv shm and MAP_ANON|MAP_SHARED mmap's (which I think
    are only ever useful if you want to share pages with a fork'd child).  I
    think it also covers a regular file that was unlinked but is still mmap'd.
    It doesn't cover mapping of a tmpfs file like /dev/shm/foo, but those are
    still available to be seen after your program crashes, until reboot.
    
    Note that this still omits plenty of cases that the old code would include,
    such as all writable shared mappings of regular files.  It also will
    include some arcane cases the old one wouldn't, like a read-only shared
    mapping of an unlinked file; that comes up e.g., for the text segment of a
    shared library or executable that was removed/renamed-over while still in
    use.

    [PATCH] no arch-specific mem_map init
    
    So, this patch started out with me trying to keep from passing contiguous,
    node-specific mem_map into free_area_init_node() and cousins.  Instead, I
    relied on some calls to pfn_to_page().
    
    This works fine and dandy when all you need is the pgdat->node_mem_map to
    do pfn_to_page().  However, the non-NUMA/DISCONTIG architectures use the
    real, global mem_map[] instead of a node_mem_map in the pfn_to_page()
    calculation.  So, I ended up effectively trying to initialize mem_map from
    itself, when it was NULL.  That was bad, and caused some very pretty colors
    on someone's screen when he tested it.
    
    So, I had to make sure to initialize the global mem_map[] before calling
    into free_area_init_node().  Then, I realized how many architectures do
    this on their own, and have comments like this:
    
            /* XXX: MRB-remove - this doesn't seem sane, should this be done somewhere else ?*/
            mem_map = NODE_DATA(0)->node_mem_map;
    
    The following patch does what my first one did (don't pass mem_map into the
    init functions), incorporates Jesse Barnes' ia64 fixes on top of that, and
    gets rid of all but one of the global mem_map initializations (parisc is
    weird).  It also magically removes more code than it adds.  It could be
    smaller, but I shamelessly added some comments.
    
    Boot-tested on ppc64, i386 (NUMAQ, plain SMP, laptop), UML (i386).

    [PATCH] vmalloc: use list of pages instead of array in vm_struct
    
    This patch assumes that there is no valid usage of

    It saves some memory and simplifies code a bit.
    
    In vmap/vunmap case vm_struct->page_list is used only
    in map_vm_area(), so it is ok to do:
    
    	addr1 = vmap(pages, count);
    	addr2 = vmap(pages, count);
    	...
    	vunmap(addr1);

    [PATCH] vmalloc: introduce __vmalloc_area() function
    
    There are 3 copy-and-paste implementations of __vmalloc() in
    arch/{arm,sparc64,x86_64}/kernel/module.c.
    
    I believe the only reason is that __vmalloc() doesn't allow
    to specify parameters of __get_vm_area().
    
    This patch splits __vmalloc() into 2 functions. The new one,
    __vmalloc_area(), can be used as follows:
    
    	vm_struct *area = __get_vm_area(...);
    	void *addr = __vmalloc_area(area, gfp, prot);

    [PATCH] ptwalk: copy_pte_range hang
    
    This patch is the odd-one-out of the sequence.  The one before adjusted
    copy_pte_range from a for loop to a do while loop, and it was therefore
    simplest to check for lockbreak before copying pte: possibility that it
    might keep getting preempted without making progress under some loads.
    
    Some loads such as startup: 2*HT*P4 with preemption cannot even reach
    multiuser login.  Suspect needs_lockbreak is broken, can get in a state
    when it remains forever true.  Investigate that later: for now, and for
    all time, it makes sense to aim for a little progress before breaking
    out; and we can manage more pte_nones than copies.

    [PATCH] ptwalk: unuse_mm
    
    Convert unuse_process pagetable walkers to loops using p?d_addr_end; but
    correct its name to unuse_mm, rename its levels to _range as elsewhere.
    
    Leave unuse_pte out-of-line since it's so rarely called; but move the
    funny activate_page inside it.  foundaddr was a leftover from before: we
    still want to break out once page is found, but no need to pass addr up.
    And we need not comment on the page_table_lock at every level.
    
    Whereas most objects shrink ~200 bytes text, swapfile.o grows slightly:
    it had earlier been converted to the addr,end style to fix a 4level bug.

    [PATCH] ptwalk: sync_page_range
    
    Convert filemap_sync pagetable walkers to loops using p?d_addr_end; use
    similar loop to split filemap_sync into chunks.  Merge filemap_sync_pte
    into sync_pte_range, cut filemap_ off the longer names, vma arg first.
    
    There is no error from filemap_sync, nor is any use made of the flags:
    if it should do something else for MS_INVALIDATE, reinstate it when that
    is implemented.  Remove the redundant flush_tlb_range from afterwards:
    as its comment noted, each dirty pte has already been flushed.

    [PATCH] ptwalk: change_protection
    
    Begin the pagetable walker cleanup with a straightforward example,
    mprotect's change_protection.  Started out from Nick Piggin's for_each
    proposal, but I prefer less hidden; and these are all do while loops,
    which degrade slightly when converted to for loops.
    
    Firmly agree with Andi and Nick that addr,end is the way to go: size is
    good at the user interface level, but unhelpful down in the loops.  And
    the habit of an "address" which is actually an offset from some base has
    bitten us several times: use proper address at each level, whyever not?
    
    Don't apply each mask at two levels: all we need is a set of macros
    pgd_addr_end, pud_addr_end, pmd_addr_end to give the address of the end
    of each range.  Which need to take the min of two addresses, with 0 as
    the greatest.  Started out with a different macro, assumed end never 0;
    but clear_page_range (alone) might be passed end 0 by some out-of-tree
    memory layouts: could special case it, but this macro compiles smaller.
    Check "addr != end" instead of "addr < end" to work on that end 0 case.

    [PATCH] ptwalk: p?d_none_or_clear_bad
    
    Replace the repetitive p?d_none, p?d_bad, p?d_ERROR, p?d_clear clauses
    by pgd_none_or_clear_bad, pud_none_or_clear_bad, pmd_none_or_clear_bad
    inlines throughout common and i386 - avoids a sprinkling of "unlikely"s.
    
    Tests inline, but unlikely error handling in mm/memory.c - so the ERROR
    file and line won't tell much; but it comes too late anyway, and hardly
    ever seen outside development.
    
    Let mremap use them in get_one_pte_map, as it already did in _nested;
    but leave follow_page and untouched_anonymous page just skipping _bad
    as before - they don't have quite the same ownership of the mm.

    [PATCH] orphaned pagecache memleak fix
    
    Chris found that with data journaling a reiserfs pagecache may be truncate
    while still pinned.  The truncation removes the page->mapping, but the page
    is still listed in the VM queues because it still has buffers.  Then during
    the journaling process, a buffer is marked dirty and that sets the PG_dirty
    bitflag as well (in mark_buffer_dirty).  After that the page is leaked
    because it's both dirty and without a mapping.
    
    So we must allow pages without mapping and dirty to reach the PagePrivate
    check.  The page->mapping will be checked again right after the PagePrivate
    check.

    [PATCH] sym2 version 2.2.0
    
    Docs
     - The sym53c8xx= kernel parameter no longer exists
     - Correct a typo
    
    Bugfixes
     - The driver really isn't capable of dealing with 64-bit bus addresses
       yet, so bail out early
     - Get rid of SYM_SCAN_TARGETS_HILO (which had no effect) and set the
       shost->reverse_ordering flag instead
     - Associate a scsi_device with the target in slave_alloc instead of
       slave_configure
    
    Printk cleanups
     - Use dev_warn/dev_info where possible
     - Delete PRINT_ADDR, PRINT_TARGET and PRINT_LUN
     - Remove sym_print_target() and sym_print_lun()
     - Make sym_print_addr() call dev_info
    
    Memory allocation related
     - Delete non-dma allocators; use kmalloc/kcalloc directly instead
     - Move memory allocation wrappers from sym_glue to sym_malloc
     - Get rid of m_addr_t; use void * or dma_addr_t as appropriate
     - Change m_pool_ident_t from a struct pci_dev * to a struct device *
     - Use dma_alloc_coherent() instead of pci_alloc_consistent()
    
    Negotiation related
     - Move scsi_transport_spi.h include from sym_glue.c to sym_glue.h
     - Store the current transfer contract settings in the starget attributes
     - Delete sym2_get_offset(), sym2_get_period(), sym2_get_width(),
       sym2_get_dt(), sym2_get_iu() and sym2_get_qas()
     - Use spi_support_wide() (and friends) instead of scsi_device_wide()
     - We don't need tinfo.prev -- we can tell if the contract changed
     - Delete SYM_OPT_ANNOUNCE_TRANSFER_RATE
     - Use spi_display_xfer_agreement()
     - Use sdev->scsi_level instead of the never-set tinfo.curr.scsi_version
     - Instead of checking current xfer settings against our goal, use a
       check_nego flag.
     - Get rid of sym_tinfo and use sym_trans directly.
     - Split the sym_trans options into flags
     - Change width from an u8 into a flag
     - Delete sym_misc.c
     - Remove sym_xpt_async_nego_wide
    
    Linuxisation
     - Use udelay() directly instead of indirecting through UDELAY and sym_udelay
     - Rename some scsi_cmnd pointers from ccb or csio to cmd
     - Use simple_strtoul() instead of a handwritten parser
     - SKIP_SPACES was always being used with 1 as a parameter, and was implicitly
       modifying ptr and len.
     - GET_INT_ARG was doing the same with ptr and len.
     - Use pci_iomap(), pci_iounmap(), ioread8() et al
     - Delete the sym_data_dmamap_*() macros
     - Replace SYM_CONF_IOMAPPED with CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_IOMAPPED
     - Delete unused SYM_HAVE_SCCB, SYM_HAVE_M_SVTOB, SYM_HAVE_M_SPOOL
    
    Misc cleanup
     - Move sym_conf.h into sym53c8xx.h
     - Eliminate the unused SYM_SETUP_MAX_LUN, SYM_SCMD_PTR
     - SYM_SETUP_PCI_PARITY and SYM_SETUP_SCSI_PARITY are always defined; simplify
     - Rename sym_pci_chip to sym_chip
     - Write sym_get_hcb() to hide nasty macro abuse
     - sym_lp() doesn't need to take the sym_hcb as an argument
     - sym_get_ccb() works better if you give it the cmd instead of the id/lun
     - We don't use cmd->host_scribble, host->dma_channel, host->n_io_port,
       host->io_port, host->base or host->irq; stop initialising them.
     - sym_tune_dev_queuing() works better if you give it the tcb rather than
       the hcb and target
     - Get rid of sym_driver_name(), just use SYM_DRIVER_NAME directly
     - OUTB/INB/etc macros implicitly use the hcb pointer; pass it explictly instead
     - Map the BARs early instead of mapping and unmapping them as necessary
     - Automatically fall back to ioport accesses if iomem isn't available
     - Get rid of tcb_p, lcb_p and ccb_p typedefs
     - Delete support for big endian chips -- 8xx chips can't be in BE mode
     - Inline sym_slot into sym_device
     - Inline sym_printb_hex() into sym_printl_hex()
     - Don't cast function return values to void
     - Introduce sym_nvram_type()
     - Pass the hcb and starget to sym_check_goals since we already have them
       in the caller
     - Some 0/NULL cleanup
     - Embed the sense buffer in the CCB so it doesn't need to be allocated
       separately

    [PATCH] x86: further EFLAGS and ptrace cleanups/fixes
    
    This patch further cleans up the appearance of TF in eflags when ptrace is
    involved.  With this, PTRACE_SINGLESTEP will not cause TF to appear in
    eflags as seen by PTRACE_GETREGS and the like, when the instruction faulted
    for some reason other than the single-step trap.
    
    This moves the check added by Dan's patch from setup_sigcontext to
    handle_signal.  This is a cosmetic difference, but I think it makes more
    sense to consolidate all the "reset registers to canonical state" work in
    the same place (i.e. put it with the syscall rollback code), separate from
    the signal handler setup.
    
    The change that matters is moving the similar check out of do_debug,
    where it only covers the case of a single-step trap.  Instead, it goes
    into the ptrace_signal_deliver macro, which is called before the ptrace
    stop for whatever signal results from whatever kind of fault in that
    instruction (or asynchronous signal).  With that, the handle_signal
    check is still needed only for the case of PTRACE_SINGLESTEP with a
    handled signal.

             iowrite8(ioread8(ioaddr + StickyHW) | 0x03, ioaddr + StickyHW);
    
    that fails. StickyHW is 0x83. lspci says:
    
    0000:00:07.0 Ethernet controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT86C100A
    [Rhine] (rev 06)
             Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 18

             Memory at dfffff80 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128]
    
    In other words, it's trying to read outside of the I/O range (0x80),
    which matches the fauling address.
    
    I'm guessing my chip revision doesn't support WOL, it's a crappy noname
    card.
    
    It does seem as if rhine_power_init checks quirks for rqWOL before
    touching any registers. Should rhine_shutdown do the same? Proposed
    patch below, which resolves the problem on my system.
    
    
    Check to make sure WOL is supported before setting it up in
    rhine_shutdown.

    [PATCH] sis900 kernel oops fix
    
    Backport of fix described below.
    
      From: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    
      Fix bug #4223.
    
      OK, this happened because we got preempted before sis900_mii_probe
      finished setting the sis_priv->mii.  Theoretically this can happen
      with SMP as well but I suppose the number of SMP machines with sis900
      is fairly small.
    
      Anyway, the fix is to make sure that sis900_mii_probe is done before
      the device can be opened.  This patch does it by moving the setup
      before register_netdevice.
    
      Since the netdev name is not available before register_netdev, I've
      changed the relevant printk's to use pci_name instead.  Note that
      one of those printk's may be called after register_netdev as well.

    [PATCH] [TCP]: Put back tcp_timer_bug_msg[] symbol export.
    
    This wrecks the ipv6 modular build for a lot of people.
    In fact, since I always build ipv6 modular I am surprised
    I never hit this.  My best guess is that my compiler is
    optimizing the reference away, but that can never be
    depended upon and the symbol export really is needed.
    
    [TCP]: Put back tcp_timer_bug_msg[] symbol export.
    
    It is needed for tcp_reset_xmit_timer(), which is invoked by
    tcp_prequeue() which is invoked from tcp_ipv6.c

    [PATCH] Fix i2c messsage flags in video drivers
    
    While working on the saa7110 driver I found a problem with the way
    various video drivers (found on Zoran-based boards) prepare i2c messages
    to be used by i2c_transfer. The drivers improperly copy the i2c client
    flags as the message flags, while both sets are mostly unrelated. The
    net effect in this case is to trigger an I2C block read instead of the
    expected I2C block write. The fix is simply not to pass any flag,
    because none are needed.
    
    I think this patch qualifies hands down as a "critical bug fix" to be
    included in whatever bug-fix-only trees exist these days. As far as I
    can see, all Zoran-based boards are broken in 2.6.11 without this patch.

    [PATCH] PA-RISC GSC interrupt fixes
    
    Two problems occurred with the recent switch to virtual interrupt numbers.
    
    The first is that two devices (eg Lasi PS/2 mouse and keyboard) can
    share the same physical interrupt and should therefore share the same
    virtual interrupt rather than have a new one assigned to them.  Fix this
    by initialising the global_irq array to NO_IRQ, then checking the array
    before assigning a new one.
    
    The second is that some GSC devices (eg HIL and EISA) can have
    two interrupts; one for normal interrupts and the other for NMI or
    high-priority.  To fix this, I introduced an auxiliary IRQ to the
    parisc_device and fill it in in Asp and Wax.

    [PATCH] v4l: MAINTAINERS file update.
    
      Hi folks,
    
    Goodbye, and that thanks for all the fish ;)
    
    After several years of v4l maintainance I'm going to switch
    to a new work field and will not be able to spend much time
    on maintaining video4linux and the drivers, so someone else
    will have to step in.
    
    I will not suddenly disappear from earth, I will be available
    for questions and patch reviews for some time, but I'll stop
    doing active development and most likely will not have the
    time to act as central patch relay for all video4linux stuff.

    Finally the big cx88 driver update which makes the cx88-dvb driver compile and
    work for some cards.  A number of changes accumulated over time ...
    
     * various new tv cards added / fixed.
     * added support for infrared remote controls.
     * some fixes in the blackbird (mpeg encoder) driver,
       starts working now.
     * configurarion for analog hauppauge cards now uses
       the tveeprom module.
     * kconfig fixups.
     * powermanagement fixups.
     * lot of tweaks for tv audio (make NICAM decoding work).
     * lot of changes in the dvb driver, still not working
       for all cards though as some more changes in the dvb
       subsystem are needed.

    [PATCH] dvb: mt352 frontend driver update
    
    This patch updates the mt352 driver to make it work with the Pinnacle 300i
    card.  Some values are calculated at runtime now instead of having hard-coded
    defaults because the defaults don't fit for the Pinnacle, and some more small
    tweaks + fixes.
    
    This was also discussed + accepted on the dvb list, going to submit directly
    because the saa7134 driver update depends on this.

    [PATCH] re-inline sched functions
    
    This could be part of the unknown 2% performance regression with
    db transaction processing benchmark.
    
    The four functions in the following patch use to be inline.  They
    are un-inlined since 2.6.7.
    
    We measured that by re-inline them back on 2.6.9, it improves performance
    for db transaction processing benchmark, +0.2% (on real hardware :-)
    
    The cost is certainly larger kernel size, cost 928 bytes on x86, and
    2728 bytes on ia64.  But certainly worth the money for enterprise
    customer since they improve performance on enterprise workload.
    
    # size vmlinux.*

    [PATCH] sched: timestamp fixes
    
    Some fixes for unsynchronised TSCs.  A task's timestamp may have been set by
    another CPU.  Although we try to adjust this correctly with the
    timestamp_last_tick field, there is no guarantee this will be exactly right.

    [PATCH] pcmcia: add pcmcia devices autonomously
    
    Add pcmcia devices without cardmgr's interaction
    
    If it's a "static" socket or the non-static socket has all its resources set
    up, there's no reason why the PCMCIA core can't detect and set up pcmcia
    devices without cardmgr's interaction.  Matching is still done in userspace,
    though; and if the PCMCIA core misses something, cardmgr can still add
    devices...

    [PATCH] pcmcia: mark resource setup as done
    
    PCMCIA device registration should only happen if we're quite confident
    there are resources available to at least map the CIS space -- else we can't
    determine manfid/cardid, whether it is a multifunction card, etc. So,
    add a flag to struct pcmcia_socket which denotes that -- and also whether
    resources were added the "old" adjust_resource_info way. On static sockets,
    it is activated upon registration, on non-static sockets, it is set upon an
    echo'ing of anything into
    /sys/class/pcmcia_socket/pcmcia_socket%n/device_possible_resources_setup_done

    [PATCH] ppc64: Add basic support for the SMU chip in iMac G5
    
    The iMac G5 and latest single-cpu PowerMac G5 have seen the venerable PMU
    (Power Management Unit) chip been sent to well deserved retirement.  It has
    been replaced by a newcomer, the SMU (System Management Unit ?) which is of
    course totally undocumented and has no open source darwin driver...  The
    SMU chip is responsible of initializing the chipset & CPU (boot process),
    power supply control, real time clock, fan control, provides some i2c
    busses, etc...  etc...  etc...
    
    This is a very basic driver based on the Open Firmware methods for
    accessing this chip.  It provides synchronous functions only, and does
    restart, shutdown, and real time clock access.  There is still no fan
    control, at least not until we have figured out how to access the fans via
    the SMU.
    
    The initial code was written by J.  Mayer <l_indien@magic.fr>, I mostly
    rewrote it to better adhere to our coding style standards ;)
    
    The patch also updates the g5_defconfig to include the SMU support by
    default.

    [PATCH] netfilter: Fix iptables userspace compatibility breakage
    
    ip_tables failed to recognize IPT_RETURN because it was defined relative
    to NF_MAX_VERDICT (which changed) and returned it to nf_iterate(). The
    old value of IPT_RETURN matches NF_REPEAT, so the hook was called again
    and again.

    AC97 Codec
    This patch series adds support for the WM9713/WM9714 family of AC97
    codecs. This family is different from 'standard' AC97 codecs in that the
    default codec power state is 'off'. i.e. performing a register reset
    will power the device down.
    
    This patch also adds better support for larger single/double channel
    enumerated mixer types.

    video/console: fix spurious rebuild
    
    kbuild does have troubles with assignmnets including '#'.
    The '#' is seen as a comment marker and this will in the end cause
    kbuild to think the commandline to build promcon_tbl.c has changed.
    This happens because the commandline is stored in the file: .promcon_tbl.c.cmd
    
    Although a bit complex the command to build promcon_tbl.c is unlikely
    to change so the workaround is to skip the check for a changed commandline.
    Now promcon_tbl.c is only rebuilt if the .uni file is newer than the .c file.

    [PATCH] printk-times bugfix for loglevel-only printks
    
    This patch fixes a bug with the recently added printk-times feature.
    
    In the case where a printk consists of only the log level (followed
    subsequently by printks with more text for the same line), the printk-times
    code doesn't correctly recognize the end of the string, and starts emitting
    chars at the 0 byte at the end of the string.
    
    The patch below fixes this problem.  It also adjusts the handling of
    printed_len in the routine, which was affected by the printk-times feature.

    [SUNGEM]: Rework PM handling and fix MAC reset on stuck receiver.
    
    This patch updates the sungem driver. I reworked all of the PM stuff, making it
    less prone to races, probably simpler to read as well, and I no longer shut the
    PHY down when the interface is down so that things like laptop-net no longer
    die (the gain in power consumption was minimal, not worth the pain). I also
    implemented basic WOL support.
    
    There is still something I'm not totally happy with in the locking
    (explained in the comment at the beginning), basically too much locking and a
    couple of places with delays in locks. I will try to improve these later on.
    
    It also adds a fix for a MAC reset issue when the receiver gets stuck.

    and memcmp. This is in the fastpath of bridge forwarding.

    [BRIDGE]: Forwarding table lockless update
    
    Optimize bridge forwarding table for the fastpath of updating
    an existing entry. Use RCU to find the entry and change it's time.
    Fallback to normal locking for insert. This gives about a 1/3
    improvement in packets forwarding per second on SMP.

    [BRIDGE]: Get rid of threaded link for forwarding timeout
    
    For 2.6, I changed the bridge forwarding table timeout code to keep
    a threaded list of in order entries. Well, it turns out that this is
    a performance hit because we end up constantly moving entries around
    in the list.  Later patch changes this to be in place update with RCU.
    
    This version just uses a 100ms garbage collection timer.

    but they're only used in a handful of places so it isn't too bad.
    I actually counted, it's about a few hundred bytes.

    [PATCH] AGP 3.0 bogosities
    
    There are other bogosities in drivers/char/agp/generic.c.  I can't
    believe Dave ever tested that code with an AGP 3.0 device.  If you pass
    in a mode that has the AGP 3.0 bit set, agp_v3_parse_one() will first
    clear that bit (and print a message), and then complain because you
    haven't got that bit set in the mode, with a message that the caller is
    broken.  Furthermore, if the mode passed in has both the 4x and 8x bits
    set, the new code will give you 4x where the old code would give you 8x
    (which is what the caller wanted).
    
    The patch below fixes this.  It will work in the 99.99% of cases where
    we have one AGP bridge and one AGP video card.  We should eventually
    cope with multiple AGP bridges, but doing the matching of bridges to
    video cards is a hard problem because the video card is not necessarily
    a child or sibling of the PCI device that we use for controlling the AGP
    bridge.  I think we need to see an actual example of a system with
    multiple AGP bridges first.
    
    Oh, and by the way, I have 3D working relatively well on my G5 with a
    64-bit kernel (and 32-bit X server and clients), which is why I care
    about AGP 3.0 support.  :)

    VFS: Retry pathname resolution after encountering ESTALE
    
     Add a mechanism for the VFS layer to retry pathname resolution if a file
     system returns ESTALE at any point during the resolution process.  Pathname
     resolution is retried once from the first component, using all real lookup
     requests.
    
     This provides effective recovery for most cases where files or directories
     have been replaced by other remote file system clients.  It also provides
     a foundation to build a mechanism by which file system clients can fail
     over transparently to a replicated server.
    
     Test-plan:
     Combinations of rsync and "ls -l" on multiple clients.  No stale file handles
     should be after directory trees are replaced.  Standard performance tests;
     little or no loss of performance is expected.

    NFS: Add emulation of BSD flock() in terms of POSIX locks on the server
    
     This makes for an interesting situation in which programs compiled
     to use flock() and running on the server will not see the locks that
     are set by the clients. The clients will, however, see both POSIX and
     flock() locks set by other clients.
    
     It is the best you can do, given the limitations of the protocol.

    RPC: Don't kill timers when calling rpc_restart_call() after rpc_delay()
    
     Currently, if we restart an RPC call after having set an RPC delay (for
     instance in the case where an NFS EJUKEBOX error has occurred) the call
     to rpc_delete_timer() at the top of the rpc_execute() loop will
     kill off our timer.
    
     This patch causes rpc_delete_timer() to detect if the rpc_task is still
     queued on a wait queue, and refuse to delete the timer if this is the case.

    Revert AGP card->bridge mapping checks.
    
    They don't work, as per Ben Herrenschmidt:
    
     "device->bus may be a host bridge, which has no bus->self -> Ooops.
    
      Unfortunately, there is no sane way to match a host bridge with it's
      eventual "self" device if it has any. The only way would be to scan for
      devices of class host bridge, but that isn't even 100% reliable.
    
      The result is that the self device (AGP bridge device) is generally a
      sibling of the actual AGP card, which is source of interesting problems,
      especially with power management."

    [ARM PATCH] 2528/1: S3C2410 - modifies S3C2410_{VA,SZ} to S3C24XX_{VA,SZ}
    
    Patch from Lucas Correia Villa Real
    
    This patch modifies ocurrences of S3C2410_{VA,SZ} to S3C24XX_{VA,SZ},
    as well as defining S3C2400 physical mappings on
    include/asm-arm/arch-s3c2410/map.h.
    
    This cleans up the naming of the virtual address macros, which are
    fixed for all S3C24XX systems. This should clean up any confusion
    about whether the virtual addresses are specific to the CPU or to
    the arch.

    The EISA EEPROM driver was being initialised too early, before miscdevs

    So stash the EEPROM address in a global variable at EISA init time,
    then pick it up later in the EISA EEPROM driver.
    
    Also ioremap() it, use readb instead of gsc_readb and rename the
    miscdev to not have a space in the name.

      drive->special is cleared silently (so CHS is not initialized properly),
      ide-disk is loaded and fails if drive uses CHS
    * ide-disk is used, drive is resetted, ide-disk is unloaded, ide-default
      takes control over drive and on the first I/O request silently clears
      drive->special without restoring settings
    
    Fix them by moving idedisk_{special,pre_reset}() and company to IDE core.

    [ide] fix DMA support for LBA48 disks on ALi15x3 (revs < 0xC5)
    
    From: Bram Verweij <bram.verweij@wanadoo.nl>
    
    The problem seems to be that ide-disk.c tries to use PIO mode for
    blocks > 137 GB (which is good), and LBA48 + DMA for blocks <= 137GB
    (which is known to be a problem, i.e., this is why the no_lba48_dma
    field was introduced in the first place).  Attached is a small patch
    that makes ide-disk.c use PIO mode for blocks > 137 GB, and LBA28 DMA
    (instead of LBA48 DMA) for blocks <= 137 GB.

    [PATCH] device-mapper: multipath hardware handler
    
    Each multipath instance can use a Hardware Handler with hooks for the
    particular hardware you're using.
    
    This patch provides the hw_handler infrastructure.
    
    So far 3 hooks are available:
    
      A status function invoked by device-mapper table and status requests.
    
      An initialisation function called when a Priority Group is selected for
      use but before any I/O is sent to it.  This function should return straight
      away, and I/O is queued until dm_pg_init_complete() is called indicating
      whether or not the initialisation was successful.  The are three error
      flags, any or all of which may be set: MP_FAIL_PATH, MP_BYPASS_PG,
      MP_ERROR_IO.
    
      An error handler which gets the opportunity to decode any error that a bio
      generated.  Patches are pending to make scsi error details available for
      dm_scsi_err_handler() to decode.

    [PATCH] device-mapper: multipath round-robin path selector.
    
    A very basic path selector: round-robin.
    
    It uses in turn each path that has not been disabled.
    
    By default, it instructs core multipath to use each path it supplies for 1000
    bios, but a different repeat_count can be set against any path to provide
    primitive load-balancing across unequal paths.

    [PATCH] device-mapper: multipath
    
    The core device-mapper multipath and path-selector code.
    
    Paths are grouped into an ordered list of Priority Groups.  Each Priority
    Group has a Path Selector which chooses which of the Priority Group's paths is
    to be used for each bio e.g.  according to some load-balancing algorithm.  If
    a bio generates an error, the path that it used gets disabled and an
    alternative path is tried.  If all the paths in a Priority Group fail, another
    Priority Group is selected.
    
    There are management commands fail_path and reinstate_path.  A path tester
    (currently implemented in userspace) is responsible for monitoring paths that
    have failed and reinstating them should they come back.
    
    Other management commands can be use to switch immediately to a specified
    Priority Group or to disable a particular Priority Group so it will only be
    tried after there are no more left.
    
    As a last resort there is an option to 'queue_if_no_path' which queues I/O if
    all paths have failed e.g.  temporarily during a firmware update or if the
    userspace daemon is slow reinstating paths.
    
    The userspace multipath tools are available at:
      http://christophe.varoqui.free.fr/
    macroflux.png is a diagram of the current architecture.
    
    From: Alasdair G Kergon <agk@redhat.com>
    
      Don't requeue I/O repeatedly if there are no paths left and the device is
      in the process of being suspended, or else the suspend can never complete.

    [PATCH] radeonfb: PLL access workaround
    
    So you remember all those weird lockups at boot that happened in late
    2.6.11-rc with radeonfb.  I posted a "workaround" which just moved code
    around a bit and it appeared to work.  I finally got some real infos about
    the problem from ATI, and it seems my "workaround" is not very safe and
    there are other potential issues realted to HW bugs when accessing the PLL
    registers.
    
    This patch implements all of these workarounds (and puts back the code
    where it was before my previous fix).

    we found several bugs in framebuffer console code in recent kernels.
    
    1. The escape sequence '\033[?25l' does not work (should disable cursor).
    
    2. When scrolling console using Shift-PgUp with cursor in the upper half
       part of the screen, cursor position is not updated.
    
    3. If cursor is placed at some character and console is scrolled using
       Shift-PgUp, that character remains on the screen.

    [PATCH] fbdev: Add mode changing via sysfs
    
    This is a first pass at adding two new sysfs attributes to
    /sys/class/graphics/fb0 for setting modes.  There are two attributes: modes
    which contains a list of valid modes, and mode which is the current mode.  To
    switch modes echo one of the entries from the modes list to the mode
    attribute.
    
    The D,V,S on the modes represents Detailed, Vesa, Standard from the DDC info.
    
    modes is root writable.  It can also be used to set the list of modes.  For
    example a /etc file could add modes that are not in the monitor's DDC.
    
    mode is user writable.  PAM would set ownership of mode at user login time.
    This provides a safe way for a user to set the mode without being root.  You
    can only set the mode to one of the modes on the list.

    [PATCH] ppc32: uninorth-agp suspend support
    
    This patch adds suspend/resume support to the Apple UniNorth AGP bridge to
    make sure AGP is properly disabled when the machine goes to sleep.  Without
    this, the r300 based laptops will fail to wakeup from sleep when using the
    new experimental r300 DRI driver.  It should also improve reliablility in
    general with other chips.
    
    Unfortunately, uninorth-agp is just a "sibling" of the video chip on the
    PCI bus, and thus ends up beeing called either before the video chip
    suspend routine, or after, depending on the HW layout or other random
    things.
    
    To make sure the device side of AGP is always disabled first and that we
    never touch the device after having put it into D2 state (which can be
    deadly), I also need the separate patch to radeonfb and aty128fb which will
    make them disabled their own side if not already done by the bridge driver.

       * added a few comments where things weren't obvious to me
    
      I tested these changes on an Au1100 based board, using the patches to its
      framebuffer code that were posted here by Christian Pellegrin[1]. I had this

    [PATCH] nvidiafb: Add update framebuffer driver for nVidia chipsets
    
    Because nVidia keeps pumping out new graphics chipsets, it is becoming
    harder to add support for these with the old rivafb code.  Currently, rivafb
    can properly support NV_ARCH_20 chipsets and older.
    
    Instead of rewriting rivafb to support the latest chipsets, I've decided to
    write a new driver, called nvidiafb.  The aim is to closely follow Xorg
    development.
    
    Currently, this driver is based on the most recent CVS Xorg nv driver. Main
    
      - console acceleration for all chipsets
      - uses DMA instead of PIO
      - better LCD/digital output support
      - better monitor detection
      - support for Riva128 will be dropped as it cannot do DMA, rivafb
        will remain as the driver for this chipset
    
    It should work with Xorg/XFree86 nv driver, but as with rivafb, is not
    compatible with the proprietary nvidia driver.
    
    Once the code becomes stable, rivafb code will be trimmed to only support the
    Riva128 and perhaps some of the older chipsets.  The code has been tested on
    several nVidia graphics card on x86 and x86_64.  I'm still waiting for
    feedback from Guido Guenther regarding ppc.
    
    This need not go to mainline immediately, as I would prefer the code to
    receive rigorous testing in the mm tree.

    This set of two patches add new options (FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT, FB_CFB_FILLRECT,
    FB_CFB_COPYAREA, FB_SOFT_CURSOR) to the framebuffer Kconfig to enable
    building the generic software cfbfillrect, cfbcopyarea, cfbimageblt and

    This patch just fixes some typos and adds retval documentation for some
    functions that were missing it.
    
    I've also a question here: skeletonfb says that xxxfb_setcolreg() should
    return a negative errno on error.  However, if the register number being
    accessed is out of bounds, 1 is returned.  Shouldn't it be better to return
    -EINVAL instead?  By looking at fbcmap.c, the retval isn't being checked
    against positive/negative values, so it doesn't make sense to return 1.

    [PATCH] cpusets - big numa cpu and memory placement
    
    This my cpuset patch, with the following changes in the last two weeks:
    
     1) Updated to 2.6.8.1-mm1
     2) [Simon Derr <Simon.Derr@bull.net>] Fix new cpuset to begin empty,
        not copied from parent.  Needed to avoid breaking exclusive property.
     3) [Dinakar Guniguntala <dino@in.ibm.com>] Finish initializing top
        cpuset from cpu_possible_map after smp_init() called.
     4) [Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>] Check on each call to __alloc_pages()
        if the current tasks cpuset mems_allowed has changed.  Use a cpuset
        generation number, bumped on any cpuset memory placement change,
        to make this check efficient.  Update the tasks mems_allowed from
        its cpuset, if the cpuset has changed.
     5) [Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>] If a task is moved to another cpuset,
        then update its cpus_allowed, using set_cpus_allowed().
     6) [Paul Jackson <pj@sgi.com>] Update Documentation/cpusets.txt to
        reflect above changes (4) and (5).
    
    I continue to recommend the following patch for inclusion in your 2.6.9-*mm
    series, when that opens.  It provides an important facility for high
    performance computing on large systems.  Simon Derr of Bull (France) and
    myself are the primary authors.  Erich Focht has indicated that NEC is also
    a potential user of this patch on the TX-7 NUMA machines, and that he
    "would very much welcome the inclusion of cpusets."
    
    I offer this update to lkml, in order to invite continued feedback.
    
    The one prerequiste patch for this cpuset patch was just posted before this
    one.  That was a patch to provide a new bitmap list format, of which
    cpusets is the first user.
    
    This patch has been built on top of 2.6.8.1-mm1, for the arch's:
    
      i386 x86_64 sparc ia64 powerpc-405 powerpc-750 sparc64
    
    with and without CONFIG_CPUSET.  It has been booted and tested on ia64
    (sn2_defconfig, SN2 hardware).  The 'alpha' arch also built, except for
    what seems to be an unrelated toolchain problem (crosstool ld sigsegv) in
    the final link step.
    
    ===
    
    Cpusets provide a mechanism for assigning a set of CPUs and Memory Nodes to
    a set of tasks.
    
    Cpusets constrain the CPU and Memory placement of tasks to only the
    processor and memory resources within a tasks current cpuset.  They form a
    nested hierarchy visible in a virtual file system.  These are the essential
    hooks, beyond what is already present, required to manage dynamic job
    placement on large systems.
    
    Cpusets require small kernel hooks in init, exit, fork, mempolicy,
    sched_setaffinity, page_alloc and vmscan.  And they require a "struct
    cpuset" pointer, a cpuset_mems_generation, and a "mems_allowed" nodemask_t
    (to go along with the "cpus_allowed" cpumask_t that's already there) in
    each task struct.
    
    These hooks:
      1) establish and propagate cpusets,
      2) enforce CPU placement in sched_setaffinity,
      3) enforce Memory placement in mbind and sys_set_mempolicy,
      4) restrict page allocation and scanning to mems_allowed, and
      5) restrict migration and set_cpus_allowed to cpus_allowed.
    
    The other required hook, restricting task scheduling to CPUs in a tasks
    cpus_allowed mask, is already present.
    
    Cpusets extend the usefulness of, the existing placement support that was
    added to Linux 2.6 kernels: sched_setaffinity() for CPU placement, and
    mbind() and set_mempolicy() for memory placement.  On smaller or dedicated
    use systems, the existing calls are often sufficient.
    
    On larger NUMA systems, running more than one, performance critical, job,
    it is necessary to be able to manage jobs in their entirety.  This includes
    providing a job with exclusive CPU and memory that no other job can use,
    and being able to list all tasks currently in a cpuset.
    
    A given job running within a cpuset, would likely use the existing
    placement calls to manage its CPU and memory placement in more detail.
    
    Cpusets are named, nested sets of CPUs and Memory Nodes.  Each cpuset is
    represented by a directory in the cpuset virtual file system, normally
    mounted at /dev/cpuset.
    
    Each cpuset directory provides the following files, which can be
    read and written:
    
      cpus:
          List of CPUs allowed to tasks in that cpuset.
    
      mems:
          List of Memory Nodes allowed to tasks in that cpuset.
    
      tasks:
          List of pid's of tasks in that cpuset.
    
      cpu_exclusive:
          Flag (0 or 1) - if set, cpuset has exclusive use of
          its CPUs (no sibling or cousin cpuset may overlap CPUs).
    
      mem_exclusive:
          Flag (0 or 1) - if set, cpuset has exclusive use of
          its Memory Nodes (no sibling or cousin may overlap).
    
      notify_on_release:
          Flag (0 or 1) - if set, then /sbin/cpuset_release_agent
          will be invoked, with the name (/dev/cpuset relative path)
          of that cpuset in argv[1], when the last user of it (task
          or child cpuset) goes away.  This supports automatic
          cleanup of abandoned cpusets.
    
    In addition one new filetype is added to the /proc file system:
    
      /proc/<pid>/cpuset:
          For each task (pid), list its cpuset path, relative to the
          root of the cpuset file system.  This file is read-only.
    
    New cpusets are created using 'mkdir' (at the shell or in C).  Old ones are
    removed using 'rmdir'.  The above files are accessed using read(2) and
    write(2) system calls, or shell commands such as 'cat' and 'echo'.
    
    The CPUs and Memory Nodes in a given cpuset are always a subset of its
    parent.  The root cpuset has all possible CPUs and Memory Nodes in the
    system.  A cpuset may be exclusive (cpu or memory) only if its parent is
    similarly exclusive.
    
    See further Documentation/cpusets.txt, at the top of the following
    patch.
    
    
    /proc interface:
    
    It is useful, when learning and making new uses of cpusets and placement to be
    able to see what are the current value of a tasks cpus_allowed and
    mems_allowed, which are the actual placement used by the kernel scheduler and
    memory allocator.
    
    The cpus_allowed and mems_allowed values are needed by user space apps that
    are micromanaging placement, such as when moving an app to a obtained by
    that app within its cpuset using sched_setaffinity, mbind and
    set_mempolicy.
    
    The cpus_allowed value is also available via the sched_getaffinity system
    call.  But since the entire rest of the cpuset API, including the display
    of mems_allowed added here, is via an ascii style presentation in /proc and
    /dev/cpuset, it is worth the extra couple lines of code to display
    cpus_allowed in the same way.
    
    This patch adds the display of these two fields to the 'status' file in the
    /proc/<pid> directory of each task.  The fields are only added if
    CONFIG_CPUSETS is enabled (which is also needed to define the mems_allowed
    field of each task).  The new output lines look like:
    
      $ tail -2 /proc/1/status
      Cpus_allowed:   ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff,ffffffff
      Mems_allowed:   ffffffff,ffffffff

    [PATCH] new bitmap list format (for cpusets)
    
    [This is a copy of the bitmap list format patch that I submitted to lkml
     on 9 Aug 2004, after removing the prefix character fluff^Wstuff.  I
     include it here again just to get it associated with the current cpuset
     patch, which will follow in a second email 10 seconds later.  -pj]
    
    A bitmap print and parse format that provides lists of ranges of numbers,
    to be first used for by cpusets (next patch).
    
    Cpusets provide a way to manage subsets of CPUs and Memory Nodes for
    scheduling and memory placement, via a new virtual file system, usually
    mounted at /dev/cpuset.  Manipulation of cpusets can be done directly via
    this file system, from the shell.
    
    However, manipulating 512 bit cpumasks or 256 bit nodemasks (which will get
    bigger) via hex mask strings is painful for humans.
    
    The intention is to provide a format for the cpu and memory mask files in
    /dev/cpusets that will stand the test of time.  This format is supported by
    a couple of new lib/bitmap.c routines, for printing and parsing these
    strings.  Wrappers for cpumask and nodemask are provided.

    [PATCH] FAT: Update ->rename() path
    
    a) If old_dir == new_dir, we don't need to update the ".." entry,
       so this doesn't touch it if unneeded.
    
    b) old algorithm is using
             1) add a new entry (doen't point the data cluster yet).
    	 2) remove a old entry.
    	 3) switch the data cluster to new entry.
    	 4) update a ".." entry
       this order lose the data cluster when between 2) and 3).
    
       Instead of above, this is using
             1) add a new entry (doen't point the data cluster yet).
    	 2) switch the data cluster to new entry.
    	 3) update a ".." entry if needed.
    	 4) remove a old entry.
       this order would not lose the data cluster, but on disk metadata is
       corrupted on some point (later, fsck would recover this corruption
       without losing the data).
    
    c) use synchronous update.
    
    d) Fix the corrupted directory check created by 1 of new algorithm.
       1) Fix fat_bmap(). If directory's ->i_start == 0, fat_bmap() is
          handling it as root directory, this removes that strange behavior.
       2) On mkdir() path if directory's ->i_start == 0, returns -EIO.

    [PATCH] fat: fix writev(), add aio support
    
    With Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
    
    These patches adds the `-o sync' and `-o dirsync' supports to fatfs.  If user
    specified that option, the fatfs does traditional ordered updates by using
    synchronous writes.  If compared to before, these patches will show a
    improvement of robustness I think.
    
    `-o sync'    - writes all buffers out before returning from syscall.
    `-o dirsync' - writes the directory's metadata, and unreferencing
                   operations of data block.
    
        remaining to be done
             fat_generic_ioctl(), fat_notify_change(),
    	 ATTR_ARCH of fat_xxx_write[v],
    	 and probably, filling hole in cont_prepare_write(),
    
    NOTE: Since fatfs doesn't have link-count, unfortunately ->rename() is
    not safe order at all.  It may make the shared blocks, but user
    shouldn't lose the data by ->rename().
    
    If you test this, please use the dosfstools at
    
    	http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/fatfsprogs.tar.bz2
    
    This is fixing several bugs of dosfstools.  And "2/29" patch from hpa adds new
    ioctl, the attached archive is also including the commands for testing it.
    
    
    This patch fixes vectored write support on fat to do the nessecary
    non-standard action done in write() aswell.
    
    Also adds aio support and makes read/write wrappers around the aio
    version.

    [PATCH] nfsd4: move delegation decisions to lock_manager callbacks
    
    Remove nfs4_check_deleg_recall().  Move its checks into __setlease() via two
    new lock_manager callbacks, fl_mylease and fl_change, so that all leases (not
    just NFSv4 lease as with nfs4_check_deleg_recall) are checked.  Default
    implementations of fl_mylease and fl_change are provided for the sake of the
    fcntl_setlease interface.  Both callbacks must always be defined.
    
    fl_mylease:
    
       for the NFSv4 server, this check is used to see if an existing lease
       comes from the same client.  For the fcntl_setlease interface, the existing
       logic is preserved.  the fl_mylease check sees if the existing lease is
       from the input filp.
    
    fl_change: called if the fl_mylease returns true
    
       the NFSv4 server does not hand out a delegation to a client that already
       has one.  -EAGAIN is returned.  Otherwise lease_modify is used.  For the
       fcntl_setlease interface, the exisiting logic is preserved: The callback
       used in lease_modify().

    [PATCH] nfsd4: fix delegation filp sharing
    
    The st_vfs_file pointer is set when the open that originally got the delegation
    is closed, and then in release_deleg we attempt to distinguish between the case
    when the original open has been closed and when it hasn't.  The resulting logic
    is complicated and buggy.
    
    It's much simpler just to keep a reference count on the struct file.

    [PATCH] nfsd4: fix delegation refcounting
    
    The delegation recall callback is setting the REAP_DELEGATION state when it
    drops the reference count to zero instead of just freeing the thing itself,
    which is needlessly complicated and bug-prone.  It's simpler just to define a
    nfs4_put_delegation() which works in the usual way and have the delegation
    recall code do call that itself.
    
    Eventually I'll convert all the nfsd4 state reference counts to struct krefs
    which will be harder to abuse in this way....

    [PATCH] nfsd4: simplify clientid hash table searches
    
    We repeat the same hash table searches in a bunch of places, and keep making
    the mistake of assuming the variable iterating over the list will be NULL when
    the search fails.  Some helper functions here simplify things a bit.
    
    While we're at it, make move_to_confirmed take just a clp instead of making the
    caller compute the hash.  This means we sometimes have to compute the hash
    multiple times, but it's only an &, so no big deal.

    Also, the debug checks in kmem_cache_destroy() should be sufficient for at

    [PATCH] nfsd4: remove utf8 checking
    
    RFC3530 says NFSv4 filenames are in UTF-8, and that servers "should" reject
    filenames that aren't valid UTF-8.  Currently we do some incomplete UTF-8
    checking, but this turns out to be more of a hindrance than a help--if we
    export a filesystem with non-UTF8 names, things break.  We might be able to
    help things if we had some idea of the exported filesystem's charset and could
    do some translation.  For now, though, the simplest solution by far seems to
    be just to remove the UTF-8 checks, making NFSv4's behaviour just like
    NFSv2/v3's.
    
    Similar problems exist with usernames.

    [PATCH] ext3: fix race between ext3 make block reservation and reservation window discard
    
    This patch fixed a race between ext3_discard_reservation() and
    ext3_try_to_allocate_with_rsv().
    
    There is a window where ext3_discard_reservation will remove an already
    unlinked reservation window node from the filesystem reservation tree:
    It thinks the reservation is still linked in the filesystem reservation
    tree, but it is actually temperately removed from the tree by
    allocate_new_reservation() when it failed to make a new reservation from
    the current group and try to make a new reservation from next block
    group.
    
    Here is how it could happen:
    
    CPU 1
    try to allocate a block in group1 with given reservation window my_rsv
    ext3_try_to_allocate_with_rsv(group
    	----copy reservation window my_rsv into local rsv_copy
    	ext3_try_to_allocate(...rsv_copy)
    		----no free block in existing reservation window,
    		----need a new reservation window
    	spin_lock(&rsv_lock);
    
    CPU 2
    
    ext3_discard_reservation
    	if (!rsv_is_empty()
    		----this is true
    	spin_lock(&rsv_lock)
    		----waiting for thread 1
    
    CPU 1:
    
    	allocate_new_reservation
    		failed to reserve blocks in this group
    		remove the window from the tree
    		rsv_window_remove(my_rsv)
    			----window node is unlinked from the tree here
    		return -1
    	spin_unlock(&rsv_lock)
    ext3_try_to_allocate_with_rsv() failed in this group
    group++
    
    CPU 2
    	spin_lock(&rsv_lock) succeed
    	rsv_remove_window ()
    		---------------break, trying to remove a unlinked node from the tree
    	....
    
    
    CPU 1:
    ext3_try_to_allocate_with_rsv(group, my_rsv)
    	rsv_is_empty is true, need a new reservation window
    	spin_lock(&rsv_lock);
    		^--------------- spinning forever
    
    We need to re-check whether the reservation window is still linked to
    the tree after grab the rsv_lock spin lock in ext3_discard_reservation,
    to prevent panic in rsv_remove_window->rb_erase.

    [PATCH] cciss: per disk queue support
    
    This patch adds per disk queue functionality.  It seems that the 2.6 kernel
    expects a queue per disk.  If you have multiple logical drives on a controller
    all of the queues actually point back to the same queue.  If a drive is
    deleted it blows us out of the water.
    
    We hold the lock during any queue operations and have added what we call a
    "fair-enough" algorithm to prevent starving out any drive.

    [PATCH] Properly share process and session keyrings with CLONE_THREAD [try #2]
    
    The attached patch causes process and session keyrings to be shared
    properly when CLONE_THREAD is in force.  It does this by moving the keyring
    pointers into struct signal_struct[*].
    
    [*] I have a patch to rename this to struct thread_group that I'll revisit
    after the advent of 2.6.11.
    
    Furthermore, once this patch is applied, process keyrings will no longer be
    allocated at fork, but will instead only be allocated when needed.
    Allocating them at fork was a way of half getting around the sharing across
    threads problem, but that's no longer necessary.
    
    This revision of the patch has the documentation changes patch rolled into it

    [PATCH] Race against parent deletion in key_user_lookup()
    
    I looked at some of the oops reports against keyrings, I think the problem
    is that the search isn't restarted after dropping the key_user_lock, *p
    will still be NULL when we get back to try_again and look through the tree.
    
    It looks like the intention was that the search start over from scratch.

    [PATCH] checkstack false positive fix

    With the old code, this was interpreted as a negative number.  The
    output line was:

    The only part of the second union in sigevent that the kernel looks at
    currently is the _tid, so that is the only bit we copy.

    All the 32 bit architectures (effectively) define SIGEV_PAD_SIZE to be
    ((SIGEV_MAX_SIZE/sizeof(int)) - 3).  So define COMPAT_SIGEV_PAD_SIZE to be
    this and replace SIGEV_PAD_SIZE32 where it is used.  It also needs to be
    used in the definition of struct compat_sigevent as most of the
    architectures would have had it 4 bytes too small in the kernel (since we
    were using SIGEV_PAD_SIZE).

    includes consecutive munmaps, mprotects with the same permissions, and mmaps
    with the same backing file and permissions and linear in the file.
    
    Second, the munmaps that always preceded mmaps are now done instead of mmap if

    To quote .config into config.c for building the result into the code, use sed
    instead of perl, as requested by one "embedded" UML user (which notes that

    patch).
    
    I've tested that there are only cosmethical differences in the produced
    config.c file, which don't change at all the result (i.e.  "a" is replaced by
    "" "a" at the beginning, which is non-significant).

    One of the problems was use of direct architecture specific semaphores (which

    I changed two semaphores to completions which compiled fine.  I have tried the
    change on 2.6.11-rc2, and it seemed to work, but I have not tested it heavily.

    [PATCH] uml: ptrace interface cleanup
    
    From: Bodo Stroesser, mostly:
    
    Gets rid of all inclusions of {sys,linux,asm}/ptrace.h since their effects and
    contents are somewhat distro- and architecture-dependent.
    arch/um/sysdep/ptrace_user is now responsible for providing the system's
    ptrace interfaces to UML.
    
    As such, it is a purely userspace header, and this exposed a couple of places
    where kernel files were including it.  One of them needed MAX_REG_OFFSET, so
    this was provided by adding a new generated header, user-constants.h, which
    includes this.
    
    Also, changed PTRACE_{PEEK,POKE}_USER to _USR since that seems to be more
    standard.

    [PATCH] x86: do not unnecessarily memset the pgdats
    
    Both the pgdats and the struct zonelist are zeroed unnecessarily.  The
    zonelist is a member of the pgdat, so any time the pgdat is cleared, so is the
    zonelist.  All of the architectures present a zeroed pgdat to the generic
    code, so it's not necessary to set it again.
    
    Not clearing it like this allows the functions to be reused by the memory
    hotplug code.  The only architecture which has a dependence on these clears is
    i386.  The previous patch in this series fixed that up.

    [PATCH] x86: memset the i386 numa pgdats in arch code
    
    The next patch in this series will remove the arch-independent clearing of the
    pgdat's.  This first patch removes the i386 dependency on that behavior.
    
    The new i386 function, remapped_pgdat_init() takes care of initializing the
    pgdats which are finally mapped after paging_init() is done.  The
    zone_sizes_init() call has to occur after the pgdat clearing.
    
    zone_sizes_init() is currently called from the end of paging_init(), because
    that's the first place where the pgdats could have been zeroed.  However,
    zone_sizes_init() really doesn't have anything to do with paging, and probably
    shouldn't be in paging_init().
    
    Moving this call into setup_memory() allows the declaration of
    zone_sizes_init() to change files as well, which means a net removal of one
    #ifdef.  It also provides a handy place to put the new function, far away from
    the paging code that it really has nothing to do with.  Moving files required
    only using highend_pfn inside of the HIGHMEM ifdef, but this saves a line of
    code anyway.

    [PATCH] ppc64: allow emulation of mfpvr on ppc64 kernel
    
    Allow userspace programs on ppc64 to use the (privileged) mfpvr instruction
    to determine the processor type.  At the moment it emulates the instruction
    to provide the real PVR value, though it could be made to lie in future if
    for some reason we wish to restrict what CPU features userspace uses.
    
    If nothing else this means that some existing ppc32 applications will now
    run on a 64-bit kernel (the 32-bit kernel has long supported this
    emulation).  It will also be necessary for ppc64 perfctr support, where
    userspace requires finer-grained cpu type information than the kernel in
    order to correctly program the performance monitor control registers.

    [PATCH] SELinux: fix selinux_setprocattr
    
    This patch changes the selinux_setprocattr hook function (which handles
    writes to nodes in the /proc/pid/attr directory) to ignore an optional

    beginning with a newline or a null in the same manner as a zero length
    value (clearing the attribute for the process and resetting it to using the
    default policy behavior).  This change is to address the divergence from
    POSIX in the existing API, as POSIX says that write(2) with a zero count
    will return zero with no other effect, as well as to simplify use of the
    API from scripts (although that isn't recommended).

    [PATCH] SELinux: pass requested protection to security_file_mmap/mprotect hooks
    
    This patch adds a reqprot parameter to the security_file_mmap and
    security_file_mprotect hooks that is the original requested protection
    value prior to any modification for read-implies-exec, and changes the
    SELinux module to allow a mode of operation (controllable via a
    checkreqprot setting) where it applies checks based on that protection
    value rather than the protection that will be applied by the kernel,
    effectively restoring SELinux's original behavior prior to the introduction
    of the read-implies-exec logic in the mainline kernel.  The patch also
    disables execmem and execmod checking entirely on PPC32, as the PPC32 ELF
    ABI presently requires RWE segments per Ulrich Drepper.
    
    At present, the read-implies-exec logic causes SELinux to see every
    mmap/mprotect read request by legacy binaries or binaries marked with
    PT_GNU_STACK RWE as a read|execute request, which tends to distort policy
    even if it reflects what is ultimately possible.  The checkreqprot setting
    allows one to set the desired behavior for SELinux, so either the current
    behavior or the original behavior is possible.  The checkreqprot value has
    a compile-time configurable default value and can also be set via boot
    parameter or at runtime via /selinux/checkreqprot if allowed by policy.
    Thanks to Chris Wright, James Morris, and Colin Walters for comments on an

    [PATCH] SELinux: enhanced MLS support
    
    This patch replaces the original experimental Multi-Level Security (MLS)
    implementation in SELinux with an enhanced MLS implementation contributed
    by Trusted Computer Solutions (TCS).
    
    The enhanced MLS implementation replaces the hardcoded MLS logic with a
    flexible constraint-based system and replaces the compile-time option for
    MLS support with a policy load-time enable based on whether MLS support was
    enabled in the policy when it was built.
    
    The latter change allows a single kernel and policy toolchain to support
    both MLS and non-MLS policies.  Compatibility is still provided as usual
    for existing policies.

    [PATCH] AHCI: fix fatal error int handling
    
    I noticed that the AHCI CI (cmd issue) reg wasn't getting cleared
    after error ints resulting in no further commands being successfully
    issued to the port.  This patch fixes.  All that's really needed is
    the 1's complement but I also removed the disabling/enabling of the
    FIS_RX b/c this isn't spec'd as necessary when handling error ints.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20050309 from Bob Moore
    
    The string-to-buffer implicit conversion code has been
    modified again after a change to the ACPI specification.
    In order to match the behavior of the other major ACPI
    implementation, the target buffer is no longer truncated
    if the source string is smaller than an existing target
    buffer. This change requires an update to the ACPI spec,
    and should eliminate the recent AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT issues.
    
    The "implicit return" support was rewritten to a new
    algorithm that solves the general case. Rather than
    attempt to determine when a method is about to exit,
    the result of every ASL operator is saved momentarily
    until the very next ASL operator is executed. Therefore,
    no matter how the method exits, there will always be a
    saved implicit return value.  This feature is only enabled
    with the acpi_gbl_enable_interpreter_slack flag which
    Linux enables unless "acpi=strict".  This should
    eliminate AE_AML_NO_RETURN_VALUE errors.
    
    Implemented implicit conversion support for the predicate
    (operand) of the If, Else, and While operators. String and
    Buffer arguments are automatically converted to Integers.
    
    Changed the string-to-integer conversion behavior to match
    the new ACPI errata: "If no integer object exists, a new
    integer is created. The ASCII string is interpreted as a
    hexadecimal constant. Each string character is interpreted
    as a hexadecimal value ('0'-'9', 'A'-'F', 'a', 'f'),
    starting with the first character as the most significant
    digit, and ending with the first non-hexadecimal character
    or end-of-string."  This means that the first non-hex
    character terminates the conversion and this is the code
    that was changed.
    
    Fixed a problem where the ObjectType operator would fail
    (fault) when used on an Index of a Package which pointed
    to a null package element.  The operator now properly
    returns zero (Uninitialized) in this case.
    
    Fixed a problem where the While operator used excessive
    memory by not properly popping the result stack during
    execution. There was no memory leak after execution,
    however. (Code provided by Valery Podrezov.)
    
    Fixed a problem where references to control methods within
    Package objects caused the method to be invoked, instead
    of producing a reference object pointing to the method.
    
    Restructured and simplified the pswalk.c module
    (acpi_ps_delete_parse_tree) to improve performance and reduce
    code size. (Code provided by Alexey Starikovskiy.)

    [NETFILTER]: Reduce call chain length in netfilter (take 2)
    
    This is a second try to fix the long chain call lengths in netfilter.
    The difference with the previous patch is that I got rid of the extra
    argument. I somehow didn't see it could be done without using the 'int
    *ret2' argument.
    
    A comment on the number of arguments to nf_hook_slow: I don't think the
    number of arguments should be decreased. For the bridge-nf code, f.e.,
    the indev argument does not equal (*pskb)->dev (this is an answer to a
    question of Rusty in the old thread).
    
    A comment on the argument change of nf_hook_slow (sk_buff * to sk_buff
    **) and the bad influence on tail call optimization possibilities. From
    the discussion in the old thread it became clear that no tail call is
    generated for the current code. So, I don't see why this is a reason not
    to accept the patch. Furthermore, if gcc ever would become able of doing
    the current code with a tail call, it should be very easy to change the
    code back to the original. In the meantime, I think this patch is the
    best known solution.

    Seems like it is the ioread8 in:
    
            /* Hit power state D3 (sleep) */
            iowrite8(ioread8(ioaddr + StickyHW) | 0x03, ioaddr + StickyHW);
    
    that fails. StickyHW is 0x83. lspci says:
    
    0000:00:07.0 Ethernet controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT86C100A [Rhine] (rev 06)

            Memory at dfffff80 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128]
    
    In other words, it's trying to read outside of the I/O range (0x80),
    which matches the fauling address.
    
    I'm guessing my chip revision doesn't support WOL, it's a crappy noname
    card.
    
    It does seem as if rhine_power_init checks quirks for rqWOL before
    touching any registers. Should rhine_shutdown do the same? Proposed
    patch below, which resolves the problem on my system.

    finished setting the sis_priv->mii.  Theoretically this can happen
    with SMP as well but I suppose the number of SMP machines with sis900
    is fairly small.
    
    Anyway, the fix is to make sure that sis900_mii_probe is done before
    the device can be opened.  This patch does it by moving the setup
    before register_netdevice.
    
    Since the netdev name is not available before register_netdev, I've
    changed the relevant printk's to use pci_name instead.  Note that
    one of those printk's may be called after register_netdev as well.

    [PATCH] class: add a semaphore to struct class, and use that instead of the subsystem rwsem.
    
    This moves us away from using the rwsem, although recursive adds and removes of class devices
    is not yet possible (nor is it really known if it even is needed.)  So this simple change is
    done instead.

    [PATCH] sysdev: remove the rwsem usage from this subsystem.
    
    If further finer grained locking is needed, we can add a lock to the sysdev_class to
    lock the class drivers list.  But if you do that, remember the global list also is still
    there and needs to be protected.  That's why I went with a simple lock for everything.

    [PATCH] rwsem: Make rwsems use interrupt disabling spinlocks
    
    The attached patch makes read/write semaphores use interrupt disabling
    spinlocks in the slow path, thus rendering the up functions and trylock
    functions available for use in interrupt context.  This matches the
    regular semaphore behaviour.
    
    I've assumed that the normal down functions must be called with interrupts
    enabled (since they might schedule), and used the irq-disabling spinlock
    variants that don't save the flags.

    Hmm, while playing around with it, I think we should create the "bus"
    link on the physical device on not on the class device.
    
    Also the current "driver" link at the class device should be removed,
    cause class devices don't have a driver. Block devices never had this
    misleading symlink.
    
     From the class device we point with the "device" link to the physical
     device, and only the physical device should have the "driver" and the
     "bus" link, as it represents the real relationship.

    [PATCH] barrier rework updates
    
    As promised to Andrew, here are the latest bits that fixup the block io
    barrier handling.
    
    - Add io scheduler ->deactivate hook to tell the io scheduler is a
      request is suspended from the block layer. cfq and as needs this hook.
    
    - Locking updates
    
    - Make sure a driver doesn't reuse the flush rq before a previous one
      has completed
    
    - Typo in the scsi_io_completion() function, the bit shift was wrong
    
    - sd needs proper timeout on the flush
    
    - remove silly debug leftover in ide-disk wrt "hdc"

    [PATCH] PA-RISC irq handling improvements
    
     - Move the bits_wide parameter from txn_alloc_data to txn_alloc_irq.
       It's too late by the time it hits txn_alloc_data(), we can only panic.
       In txn_alloc_irq, we can fail the allocation and continue.
     - Also fix a bug where we'd only allow up to half the interrupts to be
       allocated.  Not a problem for iosapic machines, but might have sucked
       on a really big GSC-based machine.
     - Add missing irq_enter() / irq_exit()
     - Allow interrupt processing to be interrupted by the timer tick so we
       actually account hard interrupts.  Also speed up the handling of CPU
       interrupts by not masking with cpu_eiem again.
     - Remove sufficiently obsolete DEBUG_IRQ code
     - Remove limit on times around the loop.  If we exit the loop while
       interrupts are still pending, we'll only be re-interrupted as soon
       as we exit the function.
     - Remove unnecessary includes

    [SERIAL] Fix 16550A misdetection
    
    Patch from Petr Vandrovec
    
    XScale detection needs access to Interrupt Enable Register on UART.
    But this register shares position with high byte clock divisor, and
    previous detection steps were leaving clock divisor and not IER
    selected, causing misdetection of all 16550A chips as XScale.
    
    Fix this by disabling access to clock divisor at the end of previous
    detection step, so chip is in same mode after each detection step.

    [IA64] fix bad emulation of unaligned semaphore opcodes
    The method used to categorize the load/store instructions in
    arch/ia64/kernel/unaligned.c is masking the entire set of instructions
    described in Table 4-33 of the 2002 Intel Itanium Volume 3: Instruction
    Set Reference.
    
    It's the set of instructions for opcode 4, mbit 0, x bit 1, described
    as Semaphore/Get FR/16-Byte Opcode Instructions.
    
    Because the IA64_OPCODE_SHIFT and IA64_OPCODE_MASK operations ignore
    the x bit, this set of instructions (including cmpxchg, xchg, and
    fetchadd among others) are processed like the corresponding opcode 4,
    mbit 0, x bit 0 instructions.
    
    This means that a cmpxchg.acq with a misaligned pointer will return the
    old value without setting the new one (rendering spin locks as No-ops)
    and that the other instructions also appear not to update memory.
    A cmpxchg.rel will be treated like a ld.s and just retry forever.
    
    The correct behavior for this class of instructions is documented
    in the file as producing failures for user code and kernel oops in
    kernel mode, but the code as implemented does not behave this way.
    
    I have user test code to demonstrate the problem if you would like
    a copy.
    
    The simple fix in this patch has been discussed with Stephane Eranian
    and David Mosberger.  It has the advantage of not requiring the
    redesign of the opcode discrimination in unaligned.c.

    [IA64] pci.c: PCI root busses need resources
    
    Using the generic setup-bus.c code currently fails on HP's Integrity
    servers because the root busses have their resources set to the whole

    This patch uses the resources in the pci_windows to provide the ranges

    This patch is from Nathan Lynch <ntl@pobox.com>.
    
    When offlining a cpu, any device interrupts which are bound to the cpu
    have their affinity forcibly reset to all cpus (the default).
    However, the value in /proc/irq/XXX/smp_affinity remains unchanged.
    Since we're doing this while all the other cpus are stopped, it should
    be safe to just call desc->handler->set_affinity and manually update
    the irq_affinity array.

    [PATCH] set RLIMIT_SIGPENDING limit based on RLIMIT_NPROC
    
    While looking into the issues Jeremy had with the RLIMIT_SIGPENDING limit,
    it occurred to me that the normal setting of this limit is bizarrely low.
    The initial hard limit setting (MAX_SIGPENDING) was taken from the old
    max_queued_signals parameter, which was for the entire system in aggregate.
    
    But even as a per-user limit, the 1024 value is incongruously low for this.
     On my machine, RLIMIT_NPROC allows me 8192 processes, but only 1024 queued
    signals, i.e.  fewer even than one pending signal in each process.  (To me,
    this really puts in doubt the sensibility of using a per-user limit for
    this rather than a per-process one, i.e.  counted in sighand_struct or
    signal_struct, which could have a much smaller reasonable value.  I don't
    recall the rationale for making this new limit per-user in the first
    place.)
    
    This patch sets the default RLIMIT_SIGPENDING limit at boot time, using the
    calculation that decides the default RLIMIT_NPROC limit.  This uses the
    same value for those two limits, which I think is still pretty conservative
    on the RLIMIT_SIGPENDING value.

    [PATCH] show RLIMIT_SIGPENDING usage in /proc/PID/status
    
    Jeremy mentioned the aggravation of not being able to tell when your
    processes are using up signal queue entries and hitting the
    RLIMIT_SIGPENDING limit.  This patch adds a line to /proc/PID/status
    showing how many queue items are in use, and allowed, for your uid.
    
    I can certainly see the appeal of having a display of the number of queued
    items specific to each process, and even the items within the process
    broken down per signal number.  However, those are not things that are
    directly counted, and ascertaining them requires iterating through the
    queue.  This patch instead gives what can be readily determined in constant
    time using the accounting already done.  I'm not sure something more
    complex is warranted just to facilitate one particular debugging need.
    With this, you can see quickly that this particular problem has come up.
    Then examination of each process's SigPnd/ShdPnd lines ought to give you an
    indication of which processes have any queued RT signals sitting around for
    a long time, and you can then attack those programs directly, though there
    is no way after the fact to determine how many queued signals with the same
    number a given process has (short of killing it and seeing the usage drop).
    
    Note you may still have a mystery if the leaking programs are not leaving
    pending RT signals queued, but rather preallocating queue items via
    timer_create.  That usage is not readily apparent in any /proc information.

    [PATCH] override RLIMIT_SIGPENDING for non-RT signals
    
    I can read POSIX to say that the siginfo_t data must be available when
    `kill' was used, as well.  This patch makes it allocate the siginfo_t, even
    when that exceeds {RLIMIT_SIGPENDING}, for any non-RT signal (< SIGRTMIN)
    not sent by sigqueue (actually, any signal that couldn't have been faked by
    a sigqueue call).  Of course, in an extreme memory shortage situation, you
    are SOL and violate POSIX a little before you die horribly from being out
    of memory anyway.
    
    The LEGACY_QUEUE logic already ensures that, for non-RT signals, at most
    one is ever on the queue.  So there really is no risk at all of unbounded
    resource consumption; the usage can reach {RLIMIT_SIGPENDING} + 31, is all.
    
    It's already the case that the limit can be exceeded by (in theory) up to
    {RLIMIT_NPROC}-1 in race conditions because the bump and the limit check
    are not atomic.  (Obviously you can only get anywhere near that many with
    assloads of preemption, but exceeding it by a few is not too unlikely.)
    This patch also fixes that accounting so that it should not be possible to
    exceed {RLIMIT_SIGPENDING} + SIGRTMIN-1 queue items per user in races.

    POSIX requires that when you claim _POSIX_CPUTIME and _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME,
    not only the clock_* calls but also timer_* calls must support the thread and
    process CPU time clocks.  This patch provides that support, building on my
    recent additions to support these clocks in the POSIX clock_* interfaces.
    This patch will not work without those changes, as well as the patch fixing
    the timer lock-siglock deadlock problem.
    
    The apparent pervasive changes to posix-timers.c are simply that some fields
    of struct k_itimer have changed name and moved into a union.  This was
    appropriate since the data structures required for the existing real-time
    timer support and for the new thread/process CPU-time timers are quite
    different.
    
    The glibc patches to support CPU time clocks using the new kernel support is
    in http://people.redhat.com/roland/glibc/kernel-cpuclocks.patch, and that
    includes tests for the timer support (if you build glibc with NPTL).
    From: Christoph Lameter <clameter@sgi.com>
    
      Your patch breaks the mmtimer driver because it used k_itimer values for
      its own purposes.  Here is a fix by defining an additional structure in
      k_itimer (same approach for mmtimer as the cpu timers):

    Fix bug identified by Alexander Nyberg <alexn@dsv.su.se>
    
    > The problem arises from code touching the union in alloc_posix_timer()
    > which makes firing go non-zero. When firing is checked in
    > posix_cpu_timer_set() it will be positive causing an infinite loop.
    >
    > So either the below fix or preferably move the INIT_LIST_HEAD(x) from
    > alloc_posix_timer() to somewhere later where it doesn't disturb the other
    > union members.
    
    Thanks for finding this problem.  The latter is what I think is the right
    solution.  This patch does that, and also removes some superfluous rezeroing.

    [PATCH] posix-timers: fix posix-timers signals lock order
    
    The posix-timers code establishes the locking order that k_itimer locks are
    outside siglocks.  However, when the signal code calls back into the
    posix-timers code to reload a timer after its signal is dequeued, it holds a
    siglock while calling do_schedule_next_timer, which gets a timer lock.
    
    I'm not sure there is any deadlock scenario possible using the real-time POSIX
    timers, because of the intricate arrangement of timer firing and resetting
    synchronization.  But with the new CPU timers code, this deadlock pops up
    right away.  Dropping the siglock here certainly doesn't hurt in the real-time
    timer cases, and it really seems like the right thing here to keep the locking
    details in the interface between signals and posix-timers code comprehensible.

    That was more or less the idea.  But I kind of figured someone would just
    tell me which one to do without actually doing any timings.  This patch
    (applies after the cpuclocks patch) makes the one decision, to use
    conditional branches rather than indirect calls in the common case.
    That is consistent with what the old code did.

    [PATCH] posix-timers: high-resolution CPU clocks for POSIX clock_* syscalls
    
    This patch provides support for thread and process CPU time clocks in the
    POSIX clock interface.  Both the existing utime and utime+stime information
    (already available via getrusage et al) can be used, as well as a new
    (potentially) more precise and accurate clock (which cannot distinguish user
    from system time).  The clock used is that provided by the `sched_clock'
    function already used internally by the scheduler.  This gives a way for
    platforms to provide the highest-resolution CPU time tracking that is
    available cheaply, and some already do so (such as x86 using TSC).  Because
    this clock is already sampled internally by the scheduler, this new tracking
    adds only the tiniest new overhead to accomplish the bookkeeping.
    
    Some notes:
    
    This allows per-thread clocks to be accessed only by other threads in the same
    process.  The only POSIX calls that access these are defined only for
    in-process use, and having this check is necessary for the userland
    implementations of the POSIX clock functions to robustly refuse stale
    clockid_t's in the face of potential PID reuse.
    
    This makes no constraint on who can see whose per-process clocks.  This
    information is already available for the VIRT and PROF (i.e.  utime and stime)
    information via /proc.  I am open to suggestions on if/how security
    constraints on who can see whose clocks should be imposed.
    
    The SCHED clock information is now available only via clock_* syscalls.  This
    means that per-thread information is not available outside the process.
    Perhaps /proc should show sched_time as well?  This would let ps et al show
    this more-accurate information.
    
    When this code is merged, it will be supported in glibc.  I have written the
    support and added some test programs for glibc, which are what I mainly used
    to test the new kernel code.  You can get those here:

    [PATCH] posix-timers: tidy up clock interfaces and consolidate dispatch logic
    
    This patch cleans up the posix-timers interfaces for defining clocks, and the
    calls to them.  It fixes some sloppy types, adds a clockid_t parameter to the
    calls that lacked it, and adds a function pointer that can be used for
    clock_getres.  It further cleans up the posix-timers.c code using the k_clock
    function pointers or default functions when no hooks are supplied,
    consolidating repeated code into shared inline functions or macros.  This
    paves the way for adding the CPU clock hooks.
    
    The mmtimer.c changes are untested, but obviously can't be wrong.  There
    aren't any other struct k_clock definitions in the tree, but any others would
    need to be updated for the function signature changes.

    [PATCH] Speed up /proc/pid/maps
    
    This patch uses find_vma() to improve the read response of /proc/pid/maps.
    It attempts to make the liner scan instead of quadratic walk and utilise rb
    tree.  Reading the file was doing sequential scan from the begining to file
    position all the time, and taking a quite long time.
    
    The improvements came from f_version/m_version and resulting in mmap_cache
    match.  Even if mmap_cache does not match, rb tree walk should be faster
    than sequential walk.  First attempt was to put the state across read
    system calls into private data.  Later got inspiration from wli's pid patch
    using f_version in readdir of /proc.  Other advantage is, f_version will be
    cleared automatically by lseek.
    
    The test program creates 32K maps and splits them into two(limited by
    max_map_count sysctl) using mprotect(0).  After the patch, the read time
    improves from many seconds to milliseconds, and does not grow superlinearly
    with number of read calls.
    
    Help taken from Peter Swain in idea and testing.

    [PATCH] random: Catastrophic reseed checks
    
    When reseeding, we must always do a "catastrophic reseed" where we pull enough
    new bits to make the new state unguessable from outputs even if we knew the
    old state.  So we must do the checks against the minimum reseed amount under
    the pool lock in extract_entropy.

    [PATCH] random: Static allocation of pools
    
    As we no longer allow resizing of pools, it makes sense to allocate and
    initialize them statically.  Remove create_entropy_store and simplify

    [PATCH] lib/sort: Heapsort implementation of sort()
    
    This patch adds a generic array sorting library routine. This is meant
    to replace qsort, which has two problem areas for kernel use.
    
    The first issue is quadratic worst-case performance. While quicksort
    worst-case datasets are rarely encountered in normal scenarios, it is
    in fact quite easy to construct worst cases for almost all quicksort
    algorithms given source or access to an element comparison callback.
    This could allow attackers to cause sorts that would otherwise take
    less than a millisecond to take seconds and sorts that should take
    less than a second to take weeks or months. Fixing this problem
    requires randomizing pivot selection with a secure random number
    generator, which is rather expensive.
    
    The second is that quicksort's recursion tracking requires either
    nontrivial amounts of stack space or dynamic memory allocation and out
    of memory error handling.
    
    By comparison, heapsort has both O(n log n) average and worst-case
    performance and practically no extra storage requirements. This
    version runs within 70-90% of the average performance of optimized
    quicksort so it should be an acceptable replacement wherever quicksort
    would be used in the kernel.
    
    Note that this function has an extra parameter for passing in an
    optimized swapping function. This is worth 10% or more over the
    typical byte-by-byte exchange functions.
    
    Benchmarks:

    The new sort routine only works if there are an even number of entries in
    the ia64 exception fix-up tables.  If the number of entries is odd the sort
    fails, and then random get_user/put_user calls can fail.

    [PATCH] base-small: introduce the CONFIG_BASE_SMALL flag
    
    This patch series introduced a new pair of CONFIG_EMBEDDED options call
    CONFIG_BASE_FULL/CONFIG_BASE_SMALL.  Disabling CONFIG_BASE_FULL sets the
    boolean CONFIG_BASE_SMALL to 1 and it is used to shrink a number of core data
    structures.  The space savings for the current batch is around 14k.
    
    This patch:
    
    Add CONFIG_BASE_SMALL for miscellaneous core size that don't warrant
    their own options. Example users to follow.

    [PATCH] autofs4 patch: autofs4_wait can leak memory
    
    There is a memory in the autofs4_wait function, if multiple processes are
    waiting on the same queue:
    
    	name = kmalloc(NAME_MAX + 1, GFP_KERNEL);
    	if (!name)
    		return -ENOMEM;
    	...
    
    	if ( !wq ) {
    		/* Create a new wait queue */
    		wq = kmalloc(sizeof(struct autofs_wait_queue), GFP_KERNEL);
    		if ( !wq ) {
    			kfree(name);
    			up(&sbi->wq_sem);
    			return -ENOMEM;
    		}
    		...
    		wq->name = name;
    
    		...
    	} else {
    		atomic_inc(&wq->wait_ctr);
    		up(&sbi->wq_sem);
    		...
           }
    
    In the else clause, we forget to free the name we kmalloc'd above.  This is
    pretty easy to trigger with the following reproducer:
    
    setup an automount map as follows:
    for n in `seq 1 48`; do echo "$n server:/export/$n" >> /etc/auto.test; done
    setup a master map entry to point at this:
    echo "/test /etc/auto.test --timeout=1" >> /etc/auto.master
    
    Now, assuming the nfs server was setup to export said directories, run the
    following shell script in two xterms:
    
    #!/bin/sh
    while true; do
            for n in `seq 1 48`; do
                    ls /test/$n
            done
            sleep 2
    done
    
    and watch the size-256 slab cache grow
    
    Within 4 minutes, I had the size-256 cache grow to 384k.  On a kernel with
    the below patch applied, the size-256 remained constant during an over-night
    run.

    [PATCH] Minor cleanups to the IPMI driver
    
    This patch cleans up the DMI handling so that multiple interfaces can be
    reported from the DMI tables and so that the DMI slave address can be
    transferred up to the upper layer.  It also adds an option to specify the
    slave address as an init parm and removes some unnecessary initializers.
    
    This patch also adds inc/dec usecount functions for the SMIs so they can
    modify the usecounts of modules they use (added because the SMB driver uses
    the I2C code).

    [PATCH] explicitly bind idle tasks
    
    With hotplug cpu and preempt, we tend to see smp_processor_id warnings from
    idle loop code because it's always checking whether its cpu has gone
    offline.  Replacing every use of smp_processor_id with _smp_processor_id in
    all idle loop code is one solution; another way is explicitly binding idle
    threads to their cpus (the smp_processor_id warning does not fire if the
    caller is bound only to the calling cpu).  This has the (admittedly slight)
    advantage of letting us know if an idle thread ever runs on the wrong cpu.

    [PATCH] partitions/msdos.c fix
    
    A well-known kernel bug is that it guesses at the partition type and the
    partitions on any disk it encounters.  This is bad because needless I/O is
    done, slowing down the boot, sometimes quite a lot, especially when I/O
    errors occur.  And it is bad because sometimes we guess wrong.
    
    In other words, we need the user space command `partition', where
    "partition -t dos /dev/sda" reads a DOS-type partition table.  (And
    "partition /dev/sda" tries all known heuristics to decide what type of
    partitioning might be present.) The two variants are: (i) partition tells
    the kernel to do the partition table reading, and (ii) partition uses partx
    to read the partition table and tells the kernel one-by-one about the
    partitions found this way.
    
    Since this is a fundamental change, a long transition period is needed, and
    that period could start with a kernel boot parameter telling the kernel not
    to do partition table parsing on a particular disk, or a particular type of
    disks, or all disks.
    
    This could have been the intro to a patch doing that, but is not.  (It is
    just an RFC.)
    
    The tiny patch below prompted the above - it was suggested by Uwe Bonnes
    who encountered USB devices without partition table where our present
    heuristics did not suffice to stop partition table parsing.  It causes the
    kernel to ignore partitions of type 0.  A band-aid.
    
    I think nobody uses such partitions seriously, but nevertheless this should
    probably live in -mm for a while to see if anybody complains.

    Add nobh_wripage() support for the filesystems which uses

    Idea here is to reduce unnecessary bufferhead creation/attachment to the

    operate by directly creating bios, but it falls back to
    __block_write_full_page() if it can't make progress.
    
    Note that this is not really generic routine and can't be used for
    filesystems which uses page->Private for anything other than buffer heads.

    [PATCH] remove mount option parsing from procfs
    
    This patch removes the mount options of the proc filesystem.  They don't
    have any effect since 2.4.something.
    
    Only proc_fill_super() calls parse_options, notably proc_remount() does
    not.  And proc_fill_super() is only called at the very first mount which in
    turn is the one caused by kern_mount() in fs/proc/root.c and that passes a
    NULL pointer as mount options string.  It is called only once because proc
    is a filesystem with a single super_block (i.e.  it uses get_sb_single()).
    
    Since noone seems to miss the uid and gid options so far I suggest to
    simply remove them.  Their function can be easily performed in userspace.
    E.g.  this (if it worked like intended):
    
        # mount -t proc -o uid=procuser,gid=procgrp proc /proc
    
    can be done like so, probably in some init script:
    
        # mount -t proc proc /proc && chown procuser:procgrp /proc
    
    But I don't see why anyone would want to do that in the first place.

    [PATCH] add timing information to printk messages
    
    Here's a little patch which is useful for showing timing information for
    kernel bootup activities.
    
    This patch adds a new Kconfig option under "Kernel Hacking" and a new
    option for the kernel command line.  It also provides a script for showing
    delta information.
    
    Note that the timing data may not be correct on some platforms until after
    time_init() is called.
    
    Recently (as of about 2.6.10) I found that the message log produced by
    dmesg is truncated when I use this feature.  That is, the first few printk
    messages of the boot sequence are not in the dmesg output, although they
    are printed to console during startup.  This is a new behavior - dmesg
    output was fine as of 2.6.9.  Increasing CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT had no effect
    on the truncation.
    
    Has something changed with printk recently?

    [PATCH] a_ops-based loop I/O
    
    Implements fallback to file_operations->write in the case that
    aops->{prepare,commit}_write are not present on the backing filesystem.
    
    The fallback happens in two different ways:
    
    - For normal loop devices, i.e.  ones which do not do transformation on
      the data but simply pass it along, we simply call fops->write.  This
      should be pretty much just as fast as using aops->{prepare,commit}_write
      directly.
    
    - For all other loop devices (e.g.  xor and cryptoloop), i.e.  all the
      ones which may be doing transformations on the data, we allocate and map
      a page (once for each bio), then for each bio vec we copy the bio vec
      page data to our mapped page, apply the loop transformation, and use
      fops->write to write out the transformed data from our page.  Once all
      bio vecs from the bio are done, we unmap and free the page.
    
    This approach is the absolute minimum of overhead I could come up with and
    for performance hungry people, as you can see I left the address space
    operations method in place for filesystems which implement
    aops->{prepare,commit}_write.
    
    I have tested this patch with normal loop devices using
    aops->{prepare,commit}_write on the backing filesystem, with normal loop
    devices using the fops->write code path and with cryptoloop devices using
    the double buffering + fops->write code path.

    there is a ksoftirqd thread for an offline processor, it is at this point that

    take down that ksoftirqd and exit it.
    
    Ensure that we only offline the processor when it's safe and never run

    warnings in ksoftirqd on cpu offline.

    [PATCH] add local bio pool support and modify dm
    
    I've had this patch reviewed by Jens, and incorporated his recommended
    fixes.
    
    The patch adds new interfaces to bio.c that support the creation of local
    bio and bvec pools.  This is important for layered drivers that need to
    allocate new bio and bvec structures in response to bio's submitted to it
    from higher up.  The layered drivers can allocate local pools of bio
    structures to preclude deadlock under global bio pool exhaustion.
    
    The device mapper source files have been modified to remove duplicate bio
    code, and to use the new interfaces to create local bio pools.
    
    From: Dave Olien <dmo@osdl.org>
    
    Change bio_clone() to use the global bio_set pool instead of the bio_set pool
    associated with the bio argument.  This is because raid5 and raid6 bio's are
    not allocated from a bio_set and have no bio_set associated with them.  This
    patch along with the patch Linux just accepted allows raid5 and raid6 to
    function.

    [PATCH] clean up and unify asm-*/resource.h files
    
    This patch does the final consolidation of asm-*/resource.h file, without
    changing any of the rlimit definitions on any architecture.  Primarily it
    removes the __ARCH_RLIMIT_ORDER method and replaces it with a more compact
    and isolated one that allows architectures to define only the offending
    rlimits.
    
    This method has the positive effect that adding a new rlimit can now be
    purely done via changing asm-generic/resource.h alone.  Previously one
    would have to patch 4 other (sparc, sparc64, alpha and mips) resource.h
    files.
    
    The patch also does style unification, whitespace cleanups and
    simplification of resource.h files and cleans up the asm-generic/resource.h
    file as well.  I've added more comments too.
    
    This patch should have no effect on any code on any architecture.  (i.e.
    it's a pure identity patch.)
    
    Tested on x86 and carefully reviewed to make sure that Sparc, Sparc64,
    MIPS and Alpha rlimits are still the same as required by the ABI.

    [PATCH] drivers/char/lp.c race fix
    
    In lp_write(), copy_from_user() is called to copy data into a statically
    allocated kernel buffer before down_interruptible() is called.  If a second
    thread of execution comes in between the copy_from_user() and the
    down_interruptible() calls, silent data corruption could result.

    [PATCH] convert /proc/driver/rtc to seq_file.
    
    The /proc/driver/rtc interface didn't have any module owner hook.  The
    simplest fix is to just convert this to the single version of seq_file.
    Also, fix initialization of rtc_dev to use C99 form.

    [PATCH] add compiler-gcc4.h
    
    With the release of gcc 4.0 being only a few months away and people
    already tring compiling with it, it's time for adding a compiler-gcc4.h .
    
    This patch contains the following changes:
    - remove compiler-gcc+.h
    - compiler-gcc4.h: new file based on a corrected compiler-gcc+.h
    - compiler.h: include compiler-gcc4.h for gcc 4
    - compiler.h: #error for gcc > 4
    - compiler-gcc3.h: remove __compiler_offsetof (there will never be a
                                                   gcc 3.5)
                       small indention corrections
    
    I've tested the compilation with both gcc 3.4.4 and a recent gcc 4.0
    snapshot from Debian experimental.

    [PATCH] minor conceptual fix for /proc/kcore header size
    
    While investigating the 2.4 memory corruption problem fixed by the patch
    previously posted, it was noticed that the 2.6 version of get_kcore_size()
    inappropriately uses sizeof(struct memelfnote) in its calculation of the
    /proc/kcore ELF header size.  What is actually stored in the header is an
    "elf_note" structure plus the 4 ASCII chars "CORE".
    
    It just so happens that on 32-bit arches, both calculations result in the
    same value (16).  But on 64-bit arches, the allocated size (24) is larger
    than necessary (16).  This does not result in any possible data corruption,
    but it might be nice to correct this "conceptual" error.

    [PATCH] sys_setpriority() euid semantics fix
    
    What _is_ inconsistent is kernel/sys.c's setpriority()/set_one_prio().
    
    It checks current->euid|uid against p->uid, which makes little sense, but
    is how we've been doing it ever since.  It's a Linux quirk documented in
    the manpage.  To make things funnier, SuS requires current->euid|uid match
    against p->euid.
    
    The patch below fixes it (and brings the logic in line with what
    setscheduler()/setaffinity() does), but if we do it then it should be done
    only in 2.6.12 or later, after good exposure in -mm.
    
    (Worst-case this could break an application but i highly doubt it: it at
    most could deny renicing another task to positive (or in very rare cases,
    to negative) nice values, which no application should crash on something
    like that, normally.)

    application has a secure VM layout, and it also makes it easier for tools
    to determine whether e.g.  the heap or stack is executable or not.

    [PATCH] Add struct request end_io callback
    
    This is needed for several things, one in-tree user which I will introduce
    after this patch.
    
    This adds a ->end_io callback to struct request, so it can be used with
    async io of any sort.  Right now users have to wait for completion in a
    blocking manner.  In the next iteration, ->waiting can be folded into
    ->end_io_data since it is just a special case of that use.

    The problem is that the add-struct-request-end_io-callback patch forgot to

    [PATCH] Fix kallsyms/insmod/rmmod race
    
    The attached patch fixes a race between kallsyms and insmod/rmmod.
    
    The problem is this:
    
     (1) The various kallsyms functions poke around in the module list without any
         locking so that they can be called from the oops handler.
    
     (2) Although insmod and rmmod use locks to exclude each other, these have no
         effect on the kallsyms function.
    
     (3) Although rmmod modifies the module state with the machine "stopped", it
         hasn't removed the metadata from the module metadata list, meaning that
         as soon as the machine is "restarted", the metadata can be observed by
         kallsyms.
    
         It's not possible to say that an item in that list should be ignored if
         it's state is marked as inactive - you can't get at the state information
         because you can't trust the metadata in which it is embedded.
    
         Furthermore, list linkage information is embedded in the metadata too, so
         you can't trust that either...
    
     (4) kallsyms may be walking the module list without a lock whilst either
         insmod or rmmod are busy changing it. insmod probably isn't a problem
         since nothing is going a way, but rmmod is as it's deleting an entry.
    
     (5) Therefore nothing that uses these functions can in any way trust any
         pointers to "static" data (such as module symbol names or module names)
         that are returned.
    
     (6) On ppc64 the problems are exacerbated since the hypervisor may reschedule
         bits of the kernel, making operations that appear adjacent occur a long
         time apart.
    
    This patch fixes the race by only linking/unlinking modules into/from the
    master module list with the machine in the "stopped" state. This means that
    any "static" information can be trusted as far as the next kernel reschedule
    on any given CPU without the need to hold any locks.
    
    However, I'm not sure how this is affected by preemption. I suspect more work
    may need to be done in that case, but I'm not entirely sure.
    
    This also means that rmmod has to bump the machine into the stopped state
    twice... but since that shouldn't be a common operation, I don't think that's
    a problem.
    
    I've amended this patch to not get spinlocks whilst in the machine locked
    state - there's no point as nothing else can be holding spinlocks.

    [PATCH] OSS Support for AC97 low power codecs
    
    This is a resend of a patch that has been applied to 2.4.  The low power
    codec functionality has also now been included in ALSA.
    
    It checks the codec ID before doing an AC97 register reset.  This allows
    the kernel to support low power codecs that are powered down by a reset
    command.  This patch also fixes some other minor issues.
    
    Changes:-
    
    - Added AC97_DEFAULT_POWER_OFF to ac97_codec_ids[]
    
    - ac97_probe now checks hardwired codec ID's before sending a reset
    
    - Added support for WM9713
    
    - Moved the codec specific inits after the mixer setup as some init
    
    - tings were being clobbered.
    
    - Added extra check so that default_digital_ops doesn't overwrite a valid
      codec_ops.  (SPDIF)

    [PATCH] Fix race between the NMI code and the CMOS clock
    
    This patch fixes a race between the CMOS clock setting and the NMI code.
    The NMI code indiscriminatly sets index registers and values in the same
    place the CMOS clock is set.  If you are setting the CMOS clock and an NMI
    occurs, Bad values could be written to or read from the CMOS RAM, or the
    NMI operation might not occur correctly.
    
    Fixing this requires creating a special lock so the NMI code can know its
    CPU owns the lock an "do the right thing" in that case.
    
    This was discovered and the fix has been tested by a very demanding
    customer who tests the heck of out the software we deliver.

    [PATCH] Factor out phase 6 of journal_commit_transaction
    
    journal_commit_transaction() is 720 lines long.  This patch pulls about 55
    of them out into their own function, removes a goto and cleans up the
    control flow a little.

    [PATCH] JBD: log space management optimization
    
    during truncate ext3 calls journal_forget() for freed blocks, but before
    these blocks go to the transaction and jbd reserves space in log for them
    (->t_outstanding_credits).  also, journal_forget() removes these blocks
    from the transaction, but doesn't correct log space reservation.  for
    example, removal of 500MB file reserves 136 blocks, but only 10 blocks go
    to the log.  a commit is expensive and correct reservation allows us to
    avoid needless commits.  here is the patch.  tested on UP.

    [PATCH] s390: irb faking.
    
    Common i/o layer changes:
     - If a device driver tries to start I/O while the common I/O layer wants
       to start path verification, don't reject the I/O with -EBUSY (which
       might prompt the driver to retry the next tick) but seemingly accept
       the I/O and deliver a fake irb with deferred cc 1 after path
       verification has finished (prompting the driver to retry the I/O).
       This prevents the device driver from doing useless retries while cio
       is still busy with path verification.

    [PATCH] kconfig: DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and SOFTWARE_SUSPEND are incompatible on i386
    
    On i386, SOFTWARE_SUSPEND requires the CPU to have PSE support, but
    DEBUG_PAGEALLOC disables PSE.  Thus, allowing both options to be enabled
    simultaneously makes no sense.  This patch disables DEBUG_PAGEALLOC if
    SOFTWARE_SUSPEND is enabled; it also displays a comment to briefly explain
    why DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is missing in that case.

    [PATCH] remove dead cyrix/centaur mtrr init code
    
    There are several cases where __init function pointers are stored in a
    general purpose struct.  For example, a SCSI template may contain a __init
    detect function.  Have not yet thought of an elegant way to avoid this.
    
    One such case is the mtrr code, where struct mtrr_ops has an init field
    pointing at __init functions.  Unless I overlook something, this case may
    be easy to settle, since the .init field is never used.
    
    The patch below comments out the declaration and initialisation of the
    .init field of struct mtrr_ops, and puts #if 0 ...  #endif around the
    centaur_mcr_init() and cyrix_arr_init() code.
    
    Simultaneously a number of variables are made static.

    [PATCH] x86: iounmap() isa special case
    
    ioremap() has special-case handling for the IS region, but inunmap() does not.
     So iounmap() generates a warning when a caller correctly performs an
    ioremap()/iounmap() sequence.
    
    Fix that by teaching iounmap() about the IS address range.

    [PATCH] Determine SCx200 CB address at run-time
    
    The current SCx200 drivers use a fixed base address of 0x9000 for the
    Configuration Block, but some systems (at least the Soekris net4801) uses a
    base address of 0x6000.  This patch first tries the fixed address then - if
    no configuration block could be found - tries the address written to the
    Configuration Block Address Scratchpad register by the BIOS.

    [PATCH] x86: remove-free_all_bootmem() #define
    
    in arch/i386/mm/init.c, there's a #define for __free_all_bootmem():
    
    #ifndef CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM
    #define __free_all_bootmem() free_all_bootmem()
    #else
    #define __free_all_bootmem() free_all_bootmem_node(NODE_DATA(0))
    #endif /* !CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM */
    
    However, both of those functions end up eventually calling the same
    thing:
    
    	free_all_bootmem_core(NODE_DATA(0))
    
    This might have once been a placeholder for a more complex bootmem
    init call, but that never happened.  So, kill off the DISCONTIG
    version, and just call free_all_bootmem() directly in both cases.

    [PATCH] Allow hot-add enabled i386 NUMA box to boot
    
    Dave Hanson mentioned I should send this patch to you.  I posted it to
    linux-mm a while ago without complaint.  This patch solves a simple
    problem related to the interpretation on the SRAT table and the info
    found in the e820.
    
    When a possible hot-add area is exposed on my box (IBM x445 with hot
    add enabled in the bios) my SRAT table correctly exposed a new node from
    the end of my physical memory to 64gb.  In the present kernels the numa
    KVA areas (based on the SRAT) are calculated before find_max_pfn.  The
    remap area is created for this large non-populated zone and the system
    dies a while later during bootup.
    
    I believe the correct things to do (as did the hot-plug community) the
    correct thing to do is the keep the node_start_end_pfn data structures
    focuses on memory that is in the system.  That is all this patch does.
    It ignores any node data (correctly reported by the SRAT) that is above
    the e820 end of memory.

    [PATCH] sh64: Initial checkstack port
    
    This provides a port of checkstack for sh64 for the simple frames
    allocated as an immediate with a single instruction.
    
    Stack frame creation on sh64 happens in a couple of different ways,
    when the frame size is less than 511 bytes an addi or addi.l is
    typically used, generally along the lines of something like:
    
    	addi{,.l}	r15, -IMM_FRAME_SIZE, r15
    
    For larger frames, this ends up getting split up into a
    movi/sub pair:
    
    	movi	IMM_FRAME_SIZE, rX
    	sub	r15, rX, r15
    
    We currently don't handle the split pair case, as basically
    any register can be used, and there is no easy way to determine
    what happens without scanning the prologue multiple times and
    using some sort of register cache (we already do something
    similar for the sh64 stack unwinder, but it would be preferable
    not to do this in perl..).
    
    This does have limited usefulness in that we are not easily able
    to check for huge frames without manual inspection, but this is
    still useful enough in the general case to be worth doing for
    the addi/addi.l case as long as people are aware of this caveat.
    
    It may be worth revisiting at a later point to try and catch the
    larger users though.

    This patch is from Amos Waterland <apw@us.ibm.com>.
    
    In pmac_setup.c, the function init_boot_display as currently written only
    makes sense with CONFIG_BOOTX_TEXT enabled, and causes a link error if it is
    not enabled.

    [PATCH] ppc64: addresses from OF getting truncated to 32-bits
    
    This patch is from Jake Moilanen <moilanen@austin.ibm.com>,
    reformatted by me.
    
    The `assigned-addresses' property in the Open Firmware device tree
    nodes for PCI devices has 64 bits of PCI bus address, but we were only
    using 32.  This patch fixes it so we use all 64.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Mode 2 PCI-X config space size fix
    
    This patch is from Brian King <brking@us.ibm.com>.
    
    When working with a PCI-X Mode 2 adapter on a PCI-X Mode 1 PPC64 system, the
    current code used to determine the config space size of a device results in a
    PCI Master abort and an EEH error, resulting in the device being taken
    offline.  This patch checks OF to see if the PCI bridge supports PCI-X Mode 2
    and fails config accesses beyond 256 bytes if it does not.

    [PATCH] Speed freeing memory for suspend.
    
    Here's a patch I've prepared which improves the speed at which memory is freed
    prior to suspend.  It should be a big gain for swsusp.  For suspend2, it isn't
    used much, but has shown big improvements when I set a very low image size
    limit and had memory quite full.
    
    1GB P4, 2.6.11+Suspend2 2.1.8.
    Soft image size limit set to 2MB to emulate Pavel's implementation (eat
    as much memory as we can).
    
    Without patch:
    Freed  16545 pages in  4000 jiffies = 16.16 MB/s
    Freed  83281 pages in 14060 jiffies = 23.14 MB/s
    Freed 237754 pages in 41482 jiffies = 22.39 MB/s
    
    With patch:
    Freed  52257 pages in  6700 jiffies = 30.46 MB/s
    Freed 105693 pages in 11035 jiffies = 37.41 MB/s
    Freed 239007 pages in 18284 jiffies = 51.06 MB/s
    
    With a less aggressive image size limit (200MB):
    
    Without the patch:
    Freed  14600 pages in  1749 jiffies = 32.61 MB/s (Anomolous!)
    Freed  88563 pages in 14719 jiffies = 23.50 MB/s
    Freed 205734 pages in 32389 jiffies = 24.81 MB/s
    
    With the patch:
    Freed  68252 pages in   496 jiffies = 537.52 MB/s
    Freed 116464 pages in   569 jiffies = 798.54 MB/s
    Freed 209699 pages in   705 jiffies = 1161.89 MB/s
    
    The later pages take more work to get, which accounts for the slower MB/s with
    smaller numbers of pages to free.  Without the patch, though, getting the
    easier pages also takes longer because we do a far greater number of
    invocations of shrink_all_memory in order to get the same number of pages.

    [PATCH] Bad page state mapcount
    
    A small change to the tests for "Bad page state", to avoid one class of the
    page_remove_rmap BUG reports, giving more information while letting the
    system continue: check page_mapcount (_mapcount != -1) rather than
    page_mapped (_mapcount >= 0).
    
    And how does _mapcount go bad?  In the case under study, it looks sure now
    that an overheating(?) Pentium III sometimes gets confused by a pair of
    instructions in the no-buddy-bitmap __free_pages_bulk, and clears the
    PG_private bit from the _mapcount field while buddying around - changing
    PG_private value changes the bit cleared from _mapcount.  Bad page state
    mapcount:-4096 would have tracked this down much sooner, and will be
    recognizable if other cpus show the same aberrant reaction to 2.6.11.
    
    The page_remove_rmap BUG does need to be replaced by more permissive and
    informative handling, but I'm not yet ready to to finalize such a patch.
    
    Please admit Colin Harrison to the Order of the Iridescent Penguin, for his
    tireless testing.

    [PATCH] readahead: improve sequential read detection
    
    1. Current code can't always detect sequential reading, in case
       when read size is not PAGE_CACHE_SIZE aligned.
    
       If application reads the file by 4096+512 chunks, we have:
       1st read: first read detected, prev_page = 2.
       2nd read: offset == 2, the read is considered random.
    
       page_cache_readahead() should treat prev_page == offset as
       sequential access. In this case it is better to ++offset,
       because of blockable_page_cache_readahead(offset, size).
    
    2. If application reads 4096 bytes with *ppos == 512, we have to
       read 2 pages, but req_size == 1 in do_generic_mapping_read().
    
       Usually it's not a problem. But in random read case it results
       in unnecessary page cache misses.

    [PATCH] readahead: simplify ra->size testing
    
    Currently page_cache_readahead() treats ra->size == 0 (first read)
    and ra->size == -1 (ra_off was called) separately, but does exactly
    the same in both cases.
    
    With this patch we may assume that the reading starts in 'ra_off()'
    state, so we don't need to consider the first read as a special case.
    
    
    file_ra_state_init() sets
    	ra->prev_page = -1;
    	ra->size      =  0;
    
    When the page_cache_readahead() is called for the first time it sets
    ra->size to nonzero value either via get_init_ra_size() or ra_off().
    So ra->size == 0 implies that ra->prev_page == -1. I am ignoring the
    case when readahead is disabled via ra->ra_pages == 0.
    
    
    page_cache_readahead detects sub-page sized reads:
    	if (offset == ra->prev_page && req_size == 1 && ra->size != 0)
    
    But if offset == ra->prev_page, then ra->size == 0 can happen only if
    offset == -1, so there is no need to check ra->size here. If application
    starts reading 16Tb file from the last page then readahead can't help.
    
    
    First offset==0 read or first sequential detection:
    	if ((ra->size == 0 && offset == 0) || (ra->size == -1 && sequential)
    could be changed to:
    	if ((ra->size == 0 && sequential) || (ra->size == -1 && sequential)
    which means:
    	if (sequential && (ra->size == 0 || ra->size == -1))
    
    
    Random case detection:
    	if (!sequential || (ra->size == 0))
    But if sequential == 1, then ra->size can't be 0, this case is already handled
    before.
    
    
    Now we have:
    
    	if (offset == ra->prev_page && req_size == 1)
    		/* sub-page reads */
    
    	if (sequential && (ra->size == 0 || ra->size == -1))
    		/* first offset==0 read or first sequential */
    
    	if (!sequential)
    		/* random case */
    
    Now ->size is checked only in one place, so ra_off() can set ra->size = 0,
    and we can just test ->size against 0.

    [PATCH] Fix mincore cornercases: overflow caused by large "len"
    
    This patch fixes 2 cornercases of overflow caused by argument len in
    sys_mincore():
    
    Case 1: len is so large that will overflow to 0 after page alignment.
    E.g. len=(size_t)(-1), i.e. 0xff...ff.
    Expected result: it's overflow and return ENOMEM.
    Current result: len is aligned to 0, then treated the same as len=0 and
    return succeed.
    This cornercase has been fixed in do_mmap_pgoff(), and here
    sys_mincore() also needs this fix.
    
    Case 2: len is a large number but will not overflow after alignment. But
    start+len will overflow.
    E.g. len=(size_t)(-PAGE_SIZE), and start>0.
    Expected result: it's overflow and return ENOMEM.
    Current result: return EINVAL. Looks like considering len as a
    non-positive value, probably influenced by manpage. But since the type
    of len is size_t, i.e. unsigned, it shouldn't be considered as
    non-positive value.
    I've also reported this inconsistency to manpage mincore.

    [PATCH] stop using "base" argument in __free_pages_bulk()
    
    Appended is a patch which stops using the zone->zone_mem_map to calculate
    the buddy and combined page pointers.  It uses the fact that the mem_map
    array is guaranteed to be contigious for the surrounding (1 << MAX_ORDER)
    pages.  The relative positions of the pages in the physical address space
    to provide the alignement; which conicidentally fixes the issue where zones
    are not aligned at MAX_ORDER.  There is a very comprehensive comment in the
    new code explaining the mathematical relationship between a page and its
    buddy so I won't reproduce it here.
    
    This kind of approach is required for CONFIG_NONLINEAR systems where the
    mem_map is not contiguous within a zone, and the zone->zone_mem_map is not
    used at all.
    
    This patch has been boot-tested on a large variety of systems and
    architectures: my P4 laptop, 16-way NUMAQ, 16-way Summit, 4-way x86 SMP,
    ppc64 LPAR, x86_64, and several ia64 configurations.
    
    It has been performance-tested on a 16-way NUMAQ.  SDET shows a very slight
    (within margin of error) performance gain.  Kernbench shows an
    approximately ~1% decrease in system time with this patch applied.  So, it
    has a likely positive performance impact.
    
    However, the patch has the potential to have a negative performance impact
    on systems with an expensive page_to_pfn() implementation.  But, I think
    the NUMAQ has one of the more expensive ones around, and it doesn't seem
    mind too much.

    [PATCH] vmscan: reclaim SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages in a single pass
    
    Here is another small OOM killer improvement.  Previously we needed to
    reclaim SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages in a single pass.  That should be changed so
    that we need only reclaim that many pages during the entire
    try_to_free_pages run, without going OOM.

    [PATCH] simpler topdown mmap layout allocator
    
    1. typos/spelling ;-)
    
    2. removed prev_vma and find_vma_prev because the condition checked
       later was always true
    
    3. moved the free_area_cache/mmap_base check into arch_unmap_area_topdown
       where i think it belongs.
    
    4. removed the extra free_area_cache setting code in the while loop
       as it only has to be set when we actually (and successfully) return
       from this function.
    
    The only visible change to the layout should be the following:

    [PATCH] vm: pageout throttling
    
    With silly pageout testcases it is possible to place huge amounts of memory
    under I/O.  With a large request queue (CFQ uses 8192 requests) it is
    possible to place _all_ memory under I/O at the same time.
    
    This means that all memory is pinned and unreclaimable and the VM gets
    upset and goes oom.
    
    The patch limits the amount of memory which is under pageout writeout to be
    a little more than the amount of memory at which balance_dirty_pages()
    callers will synchronously throttle.
    
    This means that heavy pageout activity can starve heavy writeback activity
    completely, but heavy writeback activity will not cause starvation of
    pageout.  Because we don't want a simple `dd' to be causing excessive
    latencies in page reclaim.

    [PATCH] USB Documentation update: USB error codes
    
    This patch fixes a documentation error I made earlier and clears up the
    meaning of the -ETIMEDOUT error code in urb->status.  Some host controller
    drivers _do_ use that code to indicate no response was received from the
    device, which can be confusing since the same code is also used when a
    request's timer expires.  In the future it would be a good idea to change
    the second usage (as returned by usb_bulk_msg and usb_control_msg) to
    -ETIME.

    It turns out that patch as460 is all right as it stands, and the addition
    of the patch below will resolve the problem.  It prevents the OHCI drivers
    from returning IRQ_NONE on architectures that use edge-triggered
    interrupts.  The patch has been OK'ed by Christopher and David.  Just be
    sure to apply this one and as460 at the same time!
    
    Properly speaking this problem ought to be fixed in the interrupt core
    since it affects every driver, not just USB.  Until that happens, this
    will suffice.

    [PATCH] USB: Fix race in URB submission vs. endpoint-disable
    
    This patch fixes a race between URB submission and endpoint-disable.  (I
    don't know that it's actually possible to trigger the race, but it won't
    hurt to move the appropriate test inside the region protected by the
    spinlock.)  In addition, an out-of-date comment referring to timeouts is
    removed.
    
    The patch also changes the error code returned when an URB is submitted
    for a nonexistent or disabled endpoint to -ENOENT and documents the error
    code (which was already in use by usbfs) in
    Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt.

    [PATCH] USB: Clear endpoint toggles in usb_set_interface
    
    Pete Zaitcev has found some USB devices that don't reset their endpoint
    data toggles when they get a SET-INTERFACE request.  Apparently they
    interpret the USB specification too literally when it says that the
    toggles must be reset whenever the alternate setting is "changed".
    
    Anyway, this patch calls usb_clear_halt for all endpoints in the
    altsetting whenever usb_set_interface is called and the new altsetting is
    the same as the old one.  It adds some extra overhead for the majority of
    devices that don't need it, but fortunately usb_set_interface isn't called
    very often.

    [PATCH] USB: ethernet gadget driver aligns IP headers
    
    Align incoming Ethernet packets so the header after Ethernet starts on
    something closer to a cacheline boundary.  This normally just tweaks
    performance for the IP layer.  But on one board (a no-MMU ARM9TDMI with
    no hardware support for alignment fixups) it's needed to prevent the
    IP checksumming code from failing.

    input: hid-debug.h includes resolv_event, which is not used if DEBUG is only
           enabled in hid-core, but _is_ used when DEBUG is also enabled in hid-input.
           Mark the function with __attribute__((unused)) to silence the warning
           when only hid-core is being DEBUGged.

    Input: i8042 - disable MUX mode on some Fujitsu notebooks as it
           does not seem to be working properly and requires psmouse
           module to be reloaded several times for touchpad to be
           identified correctly.
           Since none of these notebooks have external PS/2 ports
           disabling MUX should have no drawbacks.

    input: hid-debug.h uses a C99 feature (range designators) not available in
           gcc-2.95. Since gcc-2.95 is still a supported compiler for 2.6 and the
           initializers as used here add no functional value, this patch removes
           them. gcc-2.95 is then able to compile hid-core with DEBUG enabled.

    input: This patch is for the keyboard on Sharp Zaurus collie and poodle
           models (SL5000, SL5500, and SL5600).  It uses the devices exported
           in arch/arm/common/locomo.c.  The pressed state of the keys is now
           handled by the input layer rather than directly in this driver.

    if you need to test this out) can be found on my web page at

    [PATCH] usb/message: move msecs change into usb_start_wait_urb()
    
    After discussion with gregkh on IRC, I realized that the conversion can
    be pushed one layer further down into usb_start_wait_urb(), as only
    usb_{control,bulk}_msg() call this function (kaweth.c has its own
    version, which remains unchanged by this set of patches).
    
    The following incremental patch pushes the conversion into
    usb_start_wait_urb(). It should be applied after the previous ones to
    message.c [1/63 and 3/63].
    
    Description: Pushes conversion from milliseconds to jiffies one function
    further down the usb stack into usb_start_wait_urb(). The only callers
    of this function are usb_{control,bulk}_msg(); this patch makes the
    units conversion happen in one place instead of two.

    [PATCH] usb/message: change parameters of usb_control_msg() to msecs
    
    Change units of parameters being passed to usb_control_msg() to
    milliseconds. USB_CTRL_{GET,SET}_TIMEOUT's units are changed in a separate patch
    such that the the HZ multiplication is no longer necessary.

    [PATCH] USB: ohci ppc driver (1/2):  big-endian tweaks
    
    These are the remaining OHCI core (and Kconfig) updates for big-endian
    support on STB03xxx and MPC52xx PPC chips.  These are the first known
    implementations with big-endian register and memory layouts.
    
        - Two more in-memory fields, related to isochronous transfers
          have different behavior:  HCCA frame number, and ISO TD status.
    
        - Kconfig gets new OHCI options, for big-endian and little-endian.
          The default is little-endian; those PPC platforms can support
          both the on-chip big-endian version, and little-endian PCI chips.
    
    Most of the related ohci core fixes have already been merged.

    [PATCH] USB: add <linux/usb_cdc.h>
    
    This adds a new <linux/usb_cdc.h> header file, with definitions for the
    CDC class constants and structures used by various drivers.  For now
    this only has the ones Linux actually uses.  Each one is used in at least
    two or three different drivers, so sharing the definitions helps reduce
    errors.  It's also a good excuse to make sure there "sparse -Wbitwise"
    doesn't report errors in how these are used!
    
    Patches to those drivers will follow as I have time to verify the updates:
    
      - CDC ACM (for serial lines and modems)
    	* Host side support in "cdc-acm"
    	* Peripheral side support in "g_serial"
      - CDC Ethernet (cable modems, PDAs, etc)
    	* Host side support in "usbnet"
    	* Peripheral side support in "g_ether"
    
    Also, Microsoft's RNDIS is a variant of CDC ACM, providing an Ethernet model
    and implemented by g_ether; it uses these definitions too.

    [PATCH] USB: don't power down net2280 on suspend
    
    This creates a module parameter "enable_suspend", and changes the default
    behavior to avoid the need to power cycle machines with net2280 cards to
    recover from some common developer actions (like rmmod/modprobe).
    
    When set to 1, the net2280, for better or worse, will enter low-power
    mode when the USB host requests it.  This is fine except in situations
    involving a power-cycling host or rmmoding the gadget driver while
    connected to a suspended (or disconnected!) port.
    
    When set to 0 (now the default), the driver will report suspend requests
    to the gadget driver, but will not place the NET2280 into low-power mode.
    This works fine in all situations except bus-powered devices (for which
    a PCI+Linux-based NET2280 generally doesn't make much sense anyway)
    
    It also (finally...) updates NetChip references to refer to PLX; and
    updates the dates on the driver.

    Directly use wait-queues to remove remaining callers of
    interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(). Signals are not checked (except in one
    case) in the current code, so interruptible should not be necessary.
    Modify the wake_up*() calls to match the wait-queue usage. There were
    some naming conflicts, which I tried to resolve appropriately. The final
    replacement is within a #if 0 / #endif section of code, but in case that
    code is ever used again, I would prefer it had the correct interface :)

    [PATCH] USB: add usbmon, a USB monitoring framework
    
    This patch adds so-called "usbmon", or USB monitoring framework, similar
    to what tcpdump provides for Ethernet. This is an initial version, but
    it should be safe and useful. It adds an overhead of an if () statement
    into submission and giveback paths even when not monitoring, but this
    was deemed a lesser evil than stealth manipulation of function pointers.
    
    The patch makes two changes to hcd.c which make usbmon more useful:
     - Change the way we determine that DMA should not be mapped for root
       hubs, so that usbmon knows easily when it's safe to capture data.
     - Return exports of usb_bus_list and usb_bus_list_lock for those who
       wish to build usbmon as a module.
    
    This version of the patch changes #define to inlines for hooks and
    drops extra mod_ops.

    [PATCH] USB UHCI: split code from uhci-hcd.c to new file uhci-q.c
    
    The uhci-hcd.c source file has become uncomfortably large.  In
    anticipation of separate upcoming changes to the HC management (for
    suspend/resume) and the URB handling (single QH per endpoint), and for the
    sake of compatibility with the structure of the OHCI and EHCI drivers,
    this patch splits out almost all the code for scheduling URBs and sticks

    [PATCH] USB: Initialize connected ports on newly-activated hubs
    
    This patch changes the mechanism used for detecting devices that were
    already connected to a hub at the time the hub was activated.  This can
    occur in several different circumstances:
    
    	when the hub is configured for the first time,
    
    	when the hub is reset following a malfunction,
    
    	when the hub is resumed.
    
    The patch mainly addresses the third possibility, although it also handles
    the other two.  The scenario I have in mind is waking up from a system
    suspend, where the user has plugged in a new USB device while the system
    was asleep, and for some reason the hub no longer has a record of the
    connect change on that port.  (Maybe the BIOS or the boot kernel has
    interfered.)  At any rate, the patch causes the hub driver to scan all
    ports in the reactivated hub, and if it finds a connected port with no
    child device already allocated then it pretends there was a connect-change
    event on that port.
    
    This will serve to take care of ports with new devices attached that the
    driver doesn't know about.  The existing resume code already handles the
    case of ports that used to have a device but don't any longer.  The
    remaining case, where different devices are attached to the port before
    suspending and after resuming, still needs to be handled.  The resume code
    should call the same "descriptors changed" check used by usb_reset_device.
    That's a patch for another day.

    [PATCH] USB: ohci-omap updates
    
    This resolves a FIXME by making the OHCI driver handle power switching
    on the OSK board, rather than expecting tps65010 init logic to do that.
    The tps65010 support is #ifdeffed, since that driver hasn't yet been
    merged into the mainline kernel tree.
    
    It also makes OSK (and Innovator) report that they can do ganged power
    switching; the rest of usb ignores that for now, but that'll change.
    (Eventually OHCI needs to support board-specific root hub operations,
    especially for power switching and overcurrent detection, but that needs
    a few more tweaks.)

    [PATCH] USB: add 'distrust_firmware' option to ohci
    
    This replaces an undocumented/experimental "power_switching" flag with a
    more useful one that lets the driver rely on the boot firmware to report
    such capabilities.
    
    The driver still defaults to munging those informational flags (as it has
    since 2.2!), so usbcore usually won't try to power-switch with OHCI, but
    now we have a simple way to default to the behavior specified by the board
    manufacturer.
    
    Also corrects a misprint in the debug 'registers' dump:  a bit was shifted
    right by one nibble, so every controller was reported as supporting the
    legacy i8042 emulation registers.

    [PATCH] USB Storage: devices which don't process PREVENT-ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL
    
    This patch started life as as423, and has been re-generated against the
    current tip.
    
    Some storage devices don't like PREVENT-ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL commands;
    rather than returning an Invalid Command ASC they just die or imagine that
    the medium has actually been removed.  Until now people have been relying
    on the SCSI blacklist table, which can be updated at runtime, to mark
    devices which shouldn't receive these commands.  However it will be more
    efficient and easier to do it from within usb-storage, particularly since
    many of these devices share the same USB Vendor and Product IDs (while
    having different INQUIRY product strings).
    
    *sigh* We really should be trying to push as much of this as possible onto
    hotplug.  It's easier to update userspace tools than the kernel to support
    a new device.
    
    The relevant devices already have unusual_devs entries; this patch just
    adds the new flag to those entries and uses it to set a corresponding flag
    in the scsi_device structure.

    In order to calculate the speed I needed to be able to convert from

    [PATCH] NCR5380 delayed work fix and locking fix
    
    Changes to the NCR5380 driver between 2.6.9 and 2.6.10 replaced the
    driver's home-grown delayed work implementation with a call to
    schedule_delayed_work().  However, the delay argument was not passed
    correctly, so the work was usually scheduled for _way_ too far in
    the future.  This patch fixes this.
    
    NCR5380_print_status() is called from NCR5380_abort() and from
    NCR5380_bus_reset().  In at least the abort() case, the host lock
    has already been acquired by scsi_error.c:scsi_try_to_abort_command().
    NCR5380_print_status() calls NCR5380_proc_info() which also acquires
    and releases the host lock.  This patch removes the call to
    NCR5380_proc_info() from NCR5380_print_status.
    
    Cosmetic: Remove duplicated lines of code from NCR5380_abort().

    [PATCH] blacklist microtek scanmaker III
    
    To try and escape the madness of adding a zillion USB card readers
    to the SCSI whitelist, I flipped the scan all lun's by default switch
    in the fedora kernel recently to see just what breaks, in the hope
    of moving from a whitelist solution to a blacklist.
    
    Here's the first (hopefully of not too many) devices that broke.

    [IPSEC]: Get rid of dst_pmtu/ext2_header_len
    
    Here is a patch that replaces all occurrences of dst_pmtu in the TCP
    stack.  As a result we no longer need ext2_header_len.
    
    This has a nice synergetic effect with Arnaldo's latest change to
    linux/tcp.h :)
    
    I'll be removing other users of dst->path/dst_pmtu next.

    [IPSEC]: Check dst validity harder in xfrm_bundle_ok
    
    There is another bug in xfrm_bundle_ok where I forgot to
    check the validity of xdst->route.  In fact, the check
    on dst->path isn't strong enough either.  For IPv6 entries,
    dst->path->obsolete is always negative until you call
    ipv6_dst_check.  So we really need to do that here.
    
    Here's the patch to fix those two problems.  Yes I know
    my dst_check implementation is lame.  I'll come back and
    fix up all the dst_check functions by moving their dst_release
    calls out.  It proves that you were right in that IPv6 dst
    leak thread :)

    [IPSEC]: Fix xfrm[46]_update_pmtu to update top dst
    
    Let's also fix IPsec PMTU storage.  When we get an MTU update for an
    xfrm_dst, it should be done to the top dst, not the bottom dst.
    
    For example, when we get a need-to-frag message for host C behind
    a our IPsec peer B, we should be updating the dst entry for C and
    not B as we do now.
    
    I've removed the boundary checks since the same checks are done
    in ipv[46]/route.c already.

    [IPSEC]: Use dst_mtu i n xfrm[46]_output
    
    There was a lot of fun in laying the foundations.  Now it's time
    to start using it.
    
    This patch fixes the calculations in xfrm[46]_output so that we don't
    reject properly sized packets from the TCP stack.  The previous
    calculation is wrong because the xfrm overhead is not constant.
    
    After this I'll start cleaning stuff up.  For example, tcp's
    ext2_header_len and dst's path can both be removed.

    [IPSEC]: Store MTU at each xfrm_dst
    
    Finally this is the patch that sets the MTU values of each xfrm_dst

    To recap, at this point we've obtained accurate MTU values at each
    xfrm_dst.  The next step would be to start using it as
    dst_pmtu(xfrm_dst).

    [PATCH] x86: fix TF bit corner case with ptrace and signals
    
    If a debugger set the TF bit, make sure to clear it when creating a
    signal context.  Otherwise, TF will be incorrectly restored by
    sigreturn.

    [PATCH] ppc64: functions to reserve performance monitor hardware
    
    The PPC64 interrupt code includes a hook to call when an exception
    from the performance monitor unit occurs.  However, there's no way of
    reserving the hook properly, so if more than one bit of code tries to
    use it things will get ugly.  Currently oprofile is the only user, but
    there are likely to be more in future e.g. perfctr, if and when it
    reaches a fit state for merging.
    
    This patch creates functions to reserve and release the performance
    monitor hardware (including its interrupt), and makes oprofile use
    them.  It also creates a new arch/ppc64/kernel/pmc.c, in which we can
    put any future helper functions for handling the performance monitor
    counters.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Implement a vDSO and use it for signal trampoline
    
    This patch adds to the ppc64 kernel a virtual .so (vDSO) that is mapped
    into every process space, similar to the x86 vsyscall page.  However, the
    implementation is very different (and doesn't use the gate area mecanism).
    Actually, it contains two implementations, a 32 bits and a 64 bits one.
    
    These vDSO's are currently mapped at 0x100000 (+1Mb) when possible (when a
    process load section isn't already there).  In the future, we can randomize
    that address, or even imagine having a special phdr entry letting apps that
    wnat finer control over their address space to put it elsewhere (or not at
    all).
    
    The implementation adds a hook to binfmt_elf to let the architecture add a
    real VMA to the process space instead of using the gate area mecanism.
    This mecanism wasn't very suitable for ppc, we couldn't just "shove" PTE
    entries mapping kernel addresses into userland without expensive changes to
    our hash table management.  Instead, I made the vDSO be a normal VMA which,
    additionally, means it supports copy-on-write semantics if made writable
    via ptrace/mprotect, thus allowing breakpoints in the vDSO code.
    
    The current implementation of the vDSOs contain the signal trampolines with
    appropriate DWARF informations, which enable us to use non-executable
    stacks (patches to come later) along with a few more functions that we hope
    glibc will soon make good use of (this is the "hard" part now :) Note that
    the symbols exposed by the vDSO aren't "normal" function symbols, apps
    can't be expected to link against them directly, the vDSO's are both seen
    as if they were linked at 0 and the symbols just contain offsets to the
    various functions.  This is done on purpose to avoid a relocation step
    (ppc64 functions normally have descriptors with abs addresses in them).
    When glibc uses those functions, it's expected to use it's own trampolines
    that know how to reach them.
    
    In some cases, the vDSO contains several versions of a given function (for
    various CPUs), the kernel will "patch" the symbol table at boot to make it
    point to the appropriate one transparently.  What is currently implemented
    is:
    
     -  int __kernel_gettimeofday(struct timeval *tv, struct timezone *tz);
    
     This is a fully userland implementation of gettimeofday, with no barriers
     and no locks, and providing 100% equivalent results to the syscall version
    
     - void __kernel_sync_dicache(unsigned long start, unsigned long end)
    
     This function sync's the data and instruction caches (for making data
     executable), it is expected that userland loaders use this instead of
     doing it themselves, as the kernel will provide optimized versions for the
     current CPU.  Currently, the vDSO procides a full one for all CPUs prior
     to POWER5 and a nop one for POWER5 which implements hardware snooping at
     the L1 level.  In the future, an intermediate implementation may be done
     for the POWER4 and 970 which don't need the "dcbst" loop (the L1D cache is
     write-through on those).
    
     - void *__kernel_get_syscall_map(unsigned int *syscall_count);
    
     Returns a pointer to a map of implemented syscalls on the currently
     running kernel.  The map is agnostic to the size of "long", unlike kernel
     bitops, it stores bits from top to bottom so that memory actually contains
     a linear bitmap check for syscall N by testing bit (0x80000000 >> (N &
     0x1f)) of * 32 bits int at N >> 5.
    
    Note about backward compatibility issues: A bug in the ppc64 libgcc
    unwinder makes it unable to unwind stacks properly accross signals if the
    signal trampoline isn't on the stack.  This has been fixed in CVS for gcc
    4.0 and will be soon on the stable branch, but the problem exist will all
    currently used versions.
    
    That means that until glibc gets the patch to enable it's use of the vDSO
    symbols for the DWARF unwinder (rather trivial patch that will be pushed to
    glibc CVS soon hopefully), unwinding from a signal handler will not work
    for 64 bits applications.
    
    I consider this as a non-issue though as a patch is about to be produced,
    which can easily get pushed to "live" distros like debian, gentoo, fedora,
    etc...  soon enough (it breaks compatilbity with kernels below 2.4.20
    unfortunately as our signal stack layout changed, crap crap crap), as there
    are few 64 bits applications out there (expect gentoo), as it's only really
    an issue with C++ code relying on throwing exceptions out of signal
    handlers (extremely rare it seems), and as "release" distros like SLES or
    RHEL will probably have the vDSO enabled glibc _and_ the unwinder fix by
    the time they release a version with a 2.6.11 or 2.6.12 kernel anyway :)
    
    So far, I yet have to see an app failing because of that...
    
    Finally, many many many thanks to Alan Modra for writing the DWARF
    information of the signal handlers and debugging the libgcc issues !

    [PATCH] ppc64: Move systemcfg out of head.S
    
    The "systemcfg" data structure in the ppc64 kernel is something that used
    to be defined to be at a hard-coded page number in the kernel image.  This
    is not necessary (at least not any more) and is a possible problem with
    future developements.  This patch removes that constraint, which also
    simplifies various bits of assembly in head.S that were dealing with it.
    
    This is the first step of a deeper cleanup of systemcfg definition of usage
    (and ultimately removal in it's current incarnation).

    [PATCH] ppc64: collect and export low-level cpu usage statistics
    
    POWER5 machines have a per-hardware-thread register which counts at a rate
    which is proportional to the percentage of cycles on which the cpu
    dispatches an instruction for this thread (if the thread gets all the
    dispatch cycles it counts at the same rate as the timebase register).  This
    register is also context-switched by the hypervisor.  Thus it gives a
    fine-grained measure of the actual cpu usage by the thread over time.
    
    This patch adds code to read this register every timer interrupt and on
    every context switch.  The total over all virtual processors is available
    through the existing /proc/ppc64/lparcfg file, giving a way to measure the
    total cpu usage over the whole partition.

    '.tmp_gas_check' file even though we didn't actually compile up anything,
    and would get in the way of diffs.  By moving all of this logic directly
    into the 'checkbin' target, we only test gcc/gas versions when we're going
    to compile.

      Re-AIM7 benchmark with an I/O intensive load with varying numbers of

      the address space structure when running on tmpfs or ext2 on a RAM disk.

      Replacing the spinlock with a multi-reader lock fixes this problem,
      without unduly affecting anything else.
    
      Here are the benchmark results (jobs per minute at a 50-client level, average
      of 5 runs, standard deviation in parens) on an HP Olympia with 3 cells, 12
      processors, and dnotify turned off (after this spinlock, the spinlock in
      dnotify_parent is the worst contended for this workload).

      And on a pentium3 single processsor:
          1    4177(4)        4169(2)  -0.2%        3811(4)     3820(3) +0.23%
    
      I'm not sure what's happening in the 4-processor case.  The important thing to
      note is that with a spinlock, the benchmark shows worse performance for a 12
      than for an 8-way box; with the patch, the 12 way performs better, as
      expected.  We've done some runs with 16-way as well; without the patch below,
      the 16-way performs worse than the 12-way.
    
    
    It's a tricky tradeoff, but large-smp is hurt a lot more by the spinlocks than
    small-smp is by the rwlocks.  And I don't think we really want to implement
    compile-time either-or-locks.

    [PATCH] invalidate range of pages after direct IO write
    
    Presently we invalidate all of a file's pages when writing to any part of
    that file with direct-IO.
    
    After a direct IO write only invalidate the pages that the write intersected.
    invalidate_inode_pages2_range(mapping, pgoff start, pgoff end) is added and
    called from generic_file_direct_IO().
    
    While we're in there, invalidate_inode_pages2() was calling
    unmap_mapping_range() with the wrong convention in the single page case.
    It was providing the byte offset of the final page rather than the length
    of the hole being unmapped.  This is also fixed.
    
    This was lightly tested with a 10k op fsx run with O_DIRECT on a 16MB file
    in ext3 on a junky old IDE drive.  Totaling vmstat columns of blocks read
    and written during the runs shows that read traffic drops significantly.
    The run time seems to have gone down a little.
    
    Two runs before the patch gave the following user/real/sys times and total
    blocks in and out:
    
    0m28.029s 0m20.093s 0m3.166s 16673 125107
    0m27.949s 0m20.068s 0m3.227s 18426 126094
    
    and after the patch:
    
    0m26.775s 0m19.996s 0m3.060s 3505 124982
    0m26.856s 0m19.935s 0m3.052s 3505 125279
    
    akpm:
    
    - Don't look up more pages than we're going to use
    
    - Don't test page->index until we've locked the page
    
    - Check for the cursor wrapping at the end of the mapping.

    [PATCH] Move accounting function calls out of critical vm code paths
    
    In the 2.6.11 development cycle function calls have been added to lots
    of hot vm paths to do accounting. I think these should not go into the
    final 2.6.1 release because these statistics can be collected in a different
    way that does not require the updating of counters from frequently used
    vm code paths and is consistent with the methods use elsewhere in the kernel
    to obtain statistics.
    
    These function calls are
    
    acct_update_integrals	-> Account for processes based on stime changes
    update_mem_hiwater	-> takes rss and total_vm hiwater marks.
    
    acct_update_integrals is only useful to call if stime changes otherwise
    it will simply return. It is therefore best to relocate the function call
    to acct_update_integral into the function that updates stime which is
    account_system_time and remove it from the vm code paths.
    
    update_mem_hiwater finds the rss hiwater mark.  We call that from timer
    context as well.  This means that processes' high-water marks are now
    sampled statistically, at timer-interrupt time rather than
    deterministically.  This may or may not be a problem..
    
    This means that the rss limit is not always updated if rss is increased
    and thus not as accurate. But the benefit is that the rss checks do no
    pollute the vm paths and that it is consistent with the rss limit check.
    
    The following patch removes acct_update_integrals and update_mem_hiwater
    from the hot vm paths.

    From: Jay Lan <jlan@sgi.com>
    
    The new "move-accounting-function-calls-out-of-critical-vm-code-paths"
    patch in 2.6.11-rc3-mm2 was different from the code i tested.
    
    In particular, it mistakenly dropped the accounting routine calls
    in fs/exec.c. The calls in do_execve() are needed to properly
    initialize accounting fields. Specifically, the tsk->acct_stimexpd
    needs to be initialized to tsk->stime.
    
    I have discussed this with Christoph Lameter and he gave me full
    blessings to bring the calls back.

    [PATCH] Randomisation: top-of-stack randomization
    
    In addition to randomisation of the stack pointer within the stack, the stack
    itself should be randomized too.  We need both approaches, we can only
    randomize the stack itself in pagesize increments.  However randomizing large
    ranges with the stackpointer runs into the situation where a huge chunk of the
    stack rlimit is used by the randomisation; this is undesirable so we need to
    do both.

    [PATCH] Randomisation: add ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE personality
    
    Introduce a personality that disables randomisation, so that users can use
    setarch and related commands to run specific applications without
    randomisation.

    [PATCH] Randomisation: mmap randomisation
    
    The patch below randomizes the starting point of the mmap area.
    
    This has the effect that all non-prelinked shared libaries and all bigger
    malloc()s will be randomized between various invocations of the binary.
    Prelinked binaries get a address-hint from ld.so in their mmap and are thus
    exempt from this randomisation, in order to not break the prelink advantage.
    The randomisation range is 1 megabyte (this is bigger than the stack
    randomisation since the stack randomisation only needs 16 bytes alignment
    while the mmap needs page alignment, a 64kb range would not have given enough
    entropy to be effective)

    [PATCH] Randomisation: stack randomisation
    
    The patch below replaces the existing 8Kb randomisation of the userspace stack
    pointer (which is currently only done for Hyperthreaded P-IVs) with a more
    general randomisation over a 64Kb range.  64Kb is not a lot, but it's a start
    and once the dust settles we can increase this value to a more agressive
    value.

    [PATCH] Randomisation: infrastructure
    
    The patch below introduces get_random_int() and randomize_range(), two helpers
    used in later patches in the series.  get_random_int() shares the tcp/ip
    random number stuff so the CONFIG_INET ifdef needs to move slightly, and to
    reduce the damange due to that, secure_ip_id() needs to move inside random.c

    This first patch of the series introduces a sysctl (default off) that
    enables/disables the randomisation feature globally.  Since randomisation may

    the sysadmin needs a way to disable it globally.

    [PATCH] IB/mthca: QP locking optimization
    
    1. Split the QP spinlock into separate send and receive locks.
    
       The only place where we have to lock both is upon modify_qp, and
       that is not on data path.
    
    2. Avoid taking any QP locks when polling CQ.
    
       This last part is achieved by getting rid of the cur field in
       mthca_wq, and calculating the number of outstanding WQEs by
       comparing the head and tail fields.  head is only updated by
       post, tail is only updated by poll.
    
       In a rare case where an overrun is detected, a CQ is locked and the
       overrun condition is re-tested, to avoid any potential for stale
       tail values.

    [PATCH] IB/mthca: improve CQ locking part 1
    
    Avoid taking the CQ table lock in the fast path path by using
    synchronize_irq() after removing a CQ from the table to make sure that
    no completion events are still in progress.  This gets a nice speedup
    (about 4%) in IP over IB on my hardware.

    [PATCH] IB/mthca: fix reset value endianness
    
    MTHCA_RESET_VALUE must always be swapped, since the HCA expects to see
    it in big-endian order and we write it with writel.  This means on
    little-endian systems we have to swap it to big-endian order before
    writing, and on big-endian systems we need to swap it to make up for
    the additional swap that writel will do.  This fixes resetting the HCA
    on big-endian machines.

    [PATCH] nfsd: discard CACHE_HASHED flag, keeping information in refcount instead.
    
    This patch should fix a problem that has been experienced on at-least one
    busy NFS server, but it has not had lots of testing yet.  If -mm could provide
    that .....
    
    The rpc auth cache currently differentiates between a reference due to
    being in a hash chain (signalled by CACHE_HASHED flag) and any other
    reference (counted in refcnt).
    
    This is an artificial difference due to an historical accident, and it
    makes cache_put unsafe.
    
    This patch removes the distinction so now existance in a hash chain is
    counted just like any other reference.  Thus a race window in cache_put is
    closed.

    [PATCH] nfsd: svcrpc: move export table checks to a per-program pg_add_client method
    
    svcauth_null_accept() and svcauth_unix_accept() are currently hard-wired to
    check the source ip address on an incoming request against the export table,
    which make sense for nfsd but not necessarily for other rpc-based services.
    
    So instead we have the accept() method call a program-specific
    pg_authenticate() method.  We also move the call to this method into
    svc_process instead of calling it from the flavor-specific accept() routines.

    [ARM PATCH] 2459/1: ARMv6 supersections for static kernel direct mapped memory regions [updated]
    
    Patch from George G. Davis
    
    Use ARMv6 supersections for 16MiB static kernel direct mapped memory
    regions when possible.
    Based on comments received for the first version of this patch, this
    version has added a comment to clarify that ARMv6 supersections are
    only valid for the domain == 0 case and moved the supersection address
    mask and size macros before the hardware page table definitions.

    On some ARM-based processor's (eg, Atmel's AT91RM9200) it is necessary
    to signal the end-of-interrupt to the interrupt controller. This is

    [NETFILTER]: Fix multiple problems with TCP window tracking
    
    The first attached patch addresses several problems in the current TCP
    connection tracking in the 2.6 tree. Some of the problems was reported,
    others was discovered by nfsim tests:
    
    - tcp_sack function was not safe against nonlinear skbs
    - practically arbitrary RST segments (addresses, ports assumed to be
      known) could cause connection teardown in conntrack (thanks to Tim
      Burress for the bugreport and patch)
    - article on which the code was based falsely assumed that packets
      must fit completely into the window: packets must at least overlap
      (thanks to Phil Oester for the bugreport and patch)
    - state table slightly changed to handle ACK packets sent by server to
      late resent SYNs
    - tracking reopening connections reworked
    - cosmetic change: when window tracking is ignored by setting
      ip_conntrack_tcp_be_liberal to nonzero, it's ignored completely from
      now on

    [NETFILTER]: Reduce netfilter memory use on MP systems
    
    On kernels compiled with a big NR_CPUS netfilter rules would
    eat a lot of memory because all counters would be duplicated
    for all NR_CPUs CPUs.  With NR_CPUS=256 this would add up
    to many MBs of memory.
    
    This patch only allocates enough memory for the possible CPUs,
    which is usually a much smaller number than NR_CPUS.
    
    This allows loading of bigger rule sets on 64bit systems.
    There is still a limit because someone else broke vmalloc to have a 64MB
    limit on 64bit systems for single allocations, 129MB on 32bit.
    It allocates an array of pages with kmalloc and kmalloc has a 128K limit.
    To be fixed with a separate patch.
    
    64bit systems were hurt worst because they tend to have big NR_CPUS
    and the counters need more memory there, and the vmalloc limit is lower.
    But it will raise the limits even on 32bit.
    
    And in general it saves a lot of memory.
    
    Tested only on a small dual CPU box.

    [ARM PATCH] 2512/1: S3C2410 - remove bast-cpld.h from include/asm-arm/arch-s3c2410/hardware.h
    
    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    Remove the include of bast-cpld.h, as it shouldn't be here as
    it only defines some extra bast-specific registers, and does
    not affect the configuration of the hardware dependenat items.
    Ensure that the file is included in the one place it is needed
    and not included.
    This should discourage anyone else putting include files in
    which do not affect the over-all hardware definitions.

    [ARM PATCH] 2508/1: S3C2440 - timer and irq device updates
    
    Patch from Ben Dooks
    
    The patch does a number of updates, which are inter-dependant
    on each other, for the s3c2440 support and some clean-ups for
    all s3c24xx architecture in general.
    1) Remove the s3c24xx_{fclk,hclk,pclk} variables, and pass
       these values to the clock core on initialisation. This
       removes the needless double copy, as only the timer code
       uses these directly (see point 4).
       Add an over-all xtal clock to the clock core
    2) Add a sysdev driver to the clock code to ensure all the
       s3c2440 clocks are added if an s3c2440 is present.
    3) Add the new IRQs to irq.c, and initialise them if the
       sysdev for the s3c2440 is present.
    4) Change the timer code to request the timer clk and
       use it to get the frequency.
    Depends on patch 2467/1
    Thanks to Guillaume Gourat for the original patches that
    prompted this re-write.

    [ARM PATCH] 2491/1: make ixp2000 use section mappings for on-chip registers
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    This patch makes the ixp2000 port use section mappings for on-chip
    registers.  This has two advantages:
    1. It saves some TLB entries.
    2. It enables us to work around ixp2400 erratum #66, for which the
       suggested (and only) fix involves mapping all on-chip registers
       using XCB=101 instead of XCB=000.
    This patch was derived from an older patch for the same erratum
    (ARM patch ID 2265/1), made by Deepak Saxena.
    Note that this patch does not actually constitute a workaround for
    erratum #66, it merely lays the foundation for such a workaround.

    [PATCH] SCSI tape: write filemark before rewind etc. when writing
    
    The patch at the end of this message modifies the st write semantics in
    the following way: write a filemark before rewind, offline, or seek if the
    previous operation was write.
    
    This semantics is specified on the man pages of some Unices and some
    software (e.g., cpio) seems to assume this. The change makes sure that the
    last file on the tape is properly terminated with a filemark and reading the
    file does not fail at the end.

    [PATCH] mii: add GigE support
    
    Add support for GigE PHYs in MII support library.
    
    This patch allows GigE drivers to use the MII library the same way
    10/100 drivers do.
    
    Since the MII library is already used by lots of network drivers and the
    GigE MII register bit definitions were reserved when many 10/100 PHYs
    were designed, the new GigE registers are accessed only if a driver
    specifically enables it. Existing 10/100 drivers should see no behavior
    differences with this change.

    [PATCH] drivers/net/wan/z85230.c interrupt handling fix
    
    From: tom watson <lkml@tommywatson.com>
    
    While working on a driver for z85230 based board I noticed what looks like
    it could be a problem.  If the interrupt handler is handling an interrupt
    on port b and an interrupt comes in for port a, it seems to me that the
    port b handler would be called instead of the port a handler, and possibly
    hang the board until reset.
    
    Attached is a patch to set the irq methods back to port a before attempting
    to call them.

    [PATCH] Possible AMD8111e free irq issue
    
    It seems to me that if in the amd8111e_open() fuction dev->irq isn't
    zero and the irq request succeeds it might not get released anymore.
    
    Specifically, on failure of the amd8111e_restart() call the function
    returns -ENOMEM without releasing the irq. The amd8111e_restart()
    function can fail because of various pci_alloc_consistent() and
    dev_alloc_skb() calls in amd8111e_init_ring() which is being
    called by amd8111e_restart.

    1375                      dev->name, dev))

    CMIPCI driver
    Hi,
    
    I made a patch for CM8768, which has the same PCI ID but there are
    several HW diffecece, aas listed:
    
    1. 8768 has no PCM volume control.
    2. The ADC of 8768 can only record in 44.1kHz or 48kHz.
    3. 8768 can support up to 8 channels.
    
    I made change for item 2 and 3, I want to use the softvol plugin but
    don't know how to. The driver just don't generate the PCM volume slider
     for now.

    [ACPI] fix sysfs "eject" file
    
    This fixes a if-statement in setup_sys_fs_device_files().  It seems to
    assume that 'struct acpi_device_flags.ejectable' indicates whether a device
    has _EJ0 or not.  But this is not a right assumption.  It indicates whether
    a device has _EJ0|_EJD (See acpi_bus_get_flags() function).
    
    setup_sys_fs_device_files() creates 'eject' file for devices that have _EJ0
    control method under a corresponding directory in
    /sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/.  'eject' file is used to trigger
    hot-removal function from userland.

    [ACPI] fix ACPI container driver's notify handler.
    
    Previously, the handler tried to make a container device be offline if an
    ACPI_NOTIFY_BUS/DEVICE_CHECK notification is performed on the device was
    present and has its acpi_device.  But, the condition is weird.  Whenever
    the notification is performed, there should be only the following two
    conditions:
    
      1. the device is present, but does not have its acpi_device.
      2. the device is not present, but has its acpi_device.
    
    #1 is a hot-addition case, which was handled properly also in previous
    handler.  #2 is a surprising hot-removal case, which was not handled in
    previous handler.

    [ACPI] fix kobject_hotplug() use by ACPI processor and container drivers
    
    A while ago, the drivers used their own function
    'processor_run_sbin_hotplug() and container_run_sbin_hotplug()' to notify
    the agent script using /sbin/hotplug mechanism.  But, they were changed to
    use kobject_hotplug() instead and this has caused a side effect.
    
    The container driver was supposed to invoke a container.agent (user mode
    agent script) using /sbin/hotplug mechanism, but after the changes, it is
    not able to call the agent any more and kobject_hotplug() in the
    container.c became to invoke a namespace.agent instead if exists.  So, I
    would like to use the namespace.agent to handle container hotplug event (or
    something else) and let the agent to call proper agent (e.g.
    container.agent).  But, there is an issue we need to solve.  When the
    namespace.agent is called, a path name of associated kobject is passed as a
    DEVPATH (e.g./sys/firmware/ acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/DEV0).  However, the
    agent would not know what device is associated with the DEVPATH nor which
    agents to call since the DEVPATH name depends on platform.  The attached
    patch is to add .hotplug_ops member to acpi_namespace_kset structure and
    let it to set a driver name attached to the target kobject into the envp[]
    variable as a DRV_NAME element.  With this, the namespace.agent can call
    proper agents (e.g.  container.agent) by refering the DRV_NAME.

    Correct, I just checked and this one actually lacks its class. Patch
    follows.
    
    This patch adds a class definition to the elektor i2c bus driver.
    Without this definition, hardware monitoring chips located on such

    I2C controller as it does not have I2C_CLASS_HWMON set in the
    adapter class field.
    
    The attached patch initialises the adapter class to I2C_CLASS_HWMON

    [PATCH] I2C: Fix some gcc 4.0 compile failures and warnings
    
    gcc 4.0.x cvs seems to dislike "include/linux/i2c.h file" and others due
    to a current gcc 4.0.x change having to do with array declarations.
    
    Example error msg:   include/linux/i2c.h:{55,194} error: array type has
    incomplete element type
    
    A. Daplas has recently done a workaround for this on another header
    file. A thread discussing this can be found by following the link below:
    
    http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2005-02/msg00053.html
    
    The patch changes the array(struct i2c_msg) declaration used by
    *i2c_transfer and *master_xfer from "struct i2c_msg msg[]" format to
    "struct i2c_msg *msg".
    
    After some grepping, I came up with about a dozen files that used the
    format disliked by gcc4 that're addressed by the attached patch.
    Tested on gcc 3.x & gcc 4.x by configuring kernel with all i2c switches
    enabled as module, and saw no errors or warnings in i2c.

    [PATCH] I2C: Remove NULL client checks in rtc8564 driver
    
    Several functions in your rtc8564 driver verify the non-NULLity of the
    i2c client that is passed to them. It doesn't seem to be necessary, as I
    can't think of any case where these functions could possibly be called
    with a NULL i2c client. As a matter of fact, I couldn't find any similar
    driver doing such checks.
    
    My attention was brought on this by Coverity's SWAT which correctly
    noticed that three of these functions contain explicit or hidden
    dereferences of the i2c client pointer *before* the NULL check. I guess
    it wasn't a problem because the NULL case cannot happen (unless I miss
    something), but this still is confusing code.
    
    Thus I propose the following changes:

    can you please apply the attached patch (against 2.6.11-rc4, but works
    as well for 2.6.11-rc3-mm2),  that adds support for the two SMBusses of
    the nForce4 to the i2c-nforce2 i2c bus driver.  The patch is reported to
    work on the standard nForce4 (i.e. non-Ultra, non-SLI), but I expect
    that it works as well for the other nForce4 chipsets, that seem to have
    the same PCI-id for the SMBus-device.

    This patch adds support for the ST M41T00 I2C RTC chip.
    
    This rtc chip has no mechanism to freeze it's registers while being
    read; however, it will delay updating the external values of the
    registers for 250ms after a register is read.  To ensure that a sane
    time value is read, the driver verifies that the same registers values
    were read twice before returning.
    
    Also, when setting the rtc from an interrupt handler, a tasklet is used
    to provide the context required by the i2c core code.

    [PATCH] I2C: Enable w83781d and w83627hf temperature channels
    
    The chips supported by the w83781d and w83627hf drivers might come up

    does so for temp3 but omits temp2, while the w83627hf driver omits both.
    The following patch fixes that, and prints warning messages when the
    driver has to enable the channels (normally the BIOS should do it for
    us). We also skip this initialization step for the AS99127F chips, for
    which we have no documentation.
    
    This should hopefully solve the problem reported here:

    * sound/ppc/keywest
    
    The Acorn pcf8583 driver would give the i2c_client id the same value as
    the i2c_driver id, and later test that client id (in i2c). I changed it
    to test the client's driver id instead. The result is the same and the
    client id is then useless and can be removed.
    
    All other drivers here would allocate the client id to some value and
    then never use it. They are unaffected by the change.

    * tea6415c
    * tea6420
    * tuner-3036
    * vpx3220
    
    Most drivers here would include the id as part of their i2c client name
    (e.g. adv7170[0]). This looks more like an habit than something really
    needed, so I replaced the various printf by strlcpy, which should be
    slightly faster. As said earlier, clients can be differenciated thanks
    to their bus id and address if needed, so I don't think that including
    this information in the client name is wise anyway.
    
    Other drivers would either set the id to -1 or to a unique value but
    then never use it. These drivers are unaffected by the changes.

    * smsc47m1

    The vast majority of these drivers simply defined the i2c_client id
    struct member but never used it, so they are not affected at all by the
    change. Exceptions are:
    
    * lm85 and rtc8564, which would at least display the id in a debug
    message when assigning it. Not really useful though, as the id was then
    never used.
    
    * adm1026, which used the assigned id in all driver messages. However,
    since dev_* calls will append the bus number and client address to these
    messages, the id information is redundant and can go away. Also, the
    driver would allow some GPIO reprogramming on the first client only
    (id=0) and removing the id doesn't allow that anymore. I would restore a
    similar functionality if needed, but the ADM1026 chip is found on very
    few motherboards and none of these has more than one ADM1026 chip AFAIK,
    so it doesn't seem to be worth the effort.

    [PATCH] I2C: Allow it87 pwm reconfiguration
    
    Quoting myself:
    
    > As soon as you will have confirmed that everything worked as expected,
    > Jonas and I will provide a patch adding a pwm polarity reconfiguration
    > module parameter for you to test. This should give you access to the
    > PWM features of your it87 chip again, but in a safe way for a change
    > ;)
    
    Here comes this patch. The new "fix_pwm_polarity" module parameter
    allows one to force the it87 chip reconfiguration. This is only
    supported in the case the original PWM configuration is suspected to be
    bogus, and only if we think that reconfiguring the chip is safe.
    
    I wish to thank Rudolf Marek and Jonas Munsin again for their testing
    and review of my code.

    Currently touching audit.h triggers a large rebuild because it's sucked
    in via fs.h.  It's there because of the getname()/putname() requirements
    that come with CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL.  Remove header dependency by pushing
    relevant putname() implementation into fs/namei.c.  It adds function
    call overhead for putname() callers when CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL is set,
    quite minor cost for detangled source.

commit 02b8823fb180c8d2ad8b9a7e2db9ed18eb037515
Author: Vojtech Pavlik <vojtech@suse.cz>
Date:   Fri Feb 25 23:21:03 2005 +0100

    input: After testing on real world hardware, it's obvious we can't trust
           ACPIPnP nor PnPBIOS to properly report the existence of a keyboard
           and mouse port in all cases. Some BIOSes hide the ports if no mouse
           or keyboard is connected, causing trouble with eg. KVM switches.
    
           The i8042 driver now does read-only probing first, which should
           not cause any problems even if an i8042 controller really is not
           present.
    
           However, on IA64 we still need to trust ACPI, since legacy-free hardware
           is common there and invalid port accesses cause exceptions.

commit 9e2a453c4d34df7a897fc8c8f00b2f019b8fbbb2
Author: Jody McIntyre <scjody@modernduck.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 24 00:47:48 2005 -0500

    ohci1394.c allocates the legacy IR DMA Context on demand. This happens in IRQ
    path resulting in call to dma_pool_create from within interrupt. Same is true
    for de-allocation of the IR DMA Context - it happens again in IRQ path
    resulting in call to dma_pool_destroy.
    
    After attempting to fix the above by using schedule_work for delayed
    allocation and de-allocation, it was determined that it should be fixed
    simply by moving the allocation to the drivers probe() function and
    de-allocation to remove() function. This way it reduces the complexity and
    does not result into any significant wastage of resources.
    
    This patch also fixes duplicate pci pool names and removes spaces from the
    names to make it easier for parsing by scripts.
    
    Thanks go to Dave Brownell for greatly simplifying this.

    [PATCH] Orinoco driver updates - update version and changelog
    
    Previous patches have brought the in-kernel orinoco driver roughly to
    parity with version 0.14alpha2 from out-of-tree.  Update the version

    [PATCH] Orinoco driver updates - update firmware detection
    
    Update firmware detection code.  This will now reliably detect
    Intersil firmwares past verison 1.x, a serious flaw in the previous
    code.  It cleans up the code, and reduces the size of the private
    structure by using single bits for the various firmware feature flags.

    [PATCH] Orinoco driver updates - WEP updates
    
    Updates to the WEP configuration code.  This adds support for shared
    key authentication on Agere firmwares.  It also adds support (in some
    cases) for changing the WEP keys without disabling the MAC port (thus
    triggering a reassociation by the firmware).  This is needed by 802.1x
    implementations, although it's not clear if the code so far is
    sufficient to allow working 802.1x.

    [PATCH] Orinoco driver updates - delay Tx wake
    
    Delay netif_wake_queue() until the packet has actually been
    transmitted, rather than just when the firmware has copied it into its
    internal buffers.  This seems to prevent problems on some Intersil
    firmware versions (I suspect the problems were caused by the
    firmware's buffers filling up).

    [MM]: Add set_pte_at() which takes 'mm' and 'addr' args.
    
    I'm taking a slightly different approach this time around so things
    are easier to integrate.  Here is the first patch which builds the
    infrastructure.  Basically:
    
    1) Add set_pte_at() which is set_pte() with 'mm' and 'addr' arguments
       added.  All generic code uses set_pte_at().
    
       Most platforms simply get this define:
    	#define set_pte_at(mm,addr,ptep,pteval) set_pte(ptep,pteval)
    
       I chose this method over simply changing all set_pte() call sites
       because many platforms implement this in assembler and it would
       take forever to preserve the build and stabilize things if modifying
       that was necessary.
    
       Soon, with platform maintainer's help, we can kill of set_pte() entirely.
       To be honest, there are only a handful of set_pte() call sites in the
       arch specific code.
    
       Actually, in this patch ppc64 is completely set_pte() free and does not
       define it.
    
    2) pte_clear() gets 'mm' and 'addr' arguments now.
       This had a cascading effect on many ptep_test_and_*() routines.  Specifically:

    [IA64] fix IOSAPIC destinations when CONFIG_SMP=n
    
    Always use cpu_physical_id() (which is really the ID/EID of
    a processor's Local SAPIC) when programming IOSAPIC entries.
    
    Previously we sometimes used hard_smp_processor_id(), which
    is correct when CONFIG_SMP=y but wrong otherwise.

    [AGPGART] Drop the Intel-mch AGP driver.
    
    Andi Kleen points out that the intel-agp driver actually works on i865's, where
    the -mch driver doesn't.  The -mch driver was something of a failed experiment.
    Hoping that the code would be much cleaner, I forked the intel-agp driver into
    this variant, and removed some legacy bits. The result was a third the size,
    but it still was no work of art, worse yet -- it didn't even do what it said on the can.
    
    intel-agp still supports everything that the -mch driver did, so we can just
    remove this from the tree and fall back to the old driver.

    problems which do improve after retrying, so the patch retries these
    supposedly "unrecoverable" errors for such devices.
    
    In addition to the IBM ESS drive it adds a blacklist entry for the drive
    inside the MPIO HS200 Gigabox.

    [PATCH] SCSI tape descriptor based sense data support
    
    The patch at the end of this message converts the SCSI tape driver to support
    also descriptor based sense data. Test for deferred sense data have been added
    in a couple of places and the EOM tests have been unified. Some tests have been
    simplified but the patch is not meant to change the current behavior. The
    patch is against 2.6.11-rc4 and has been tested to some extent.
    
    The patch also includes the msleep_interruptible change from from kernel
    janitors.
    
    Thanks to Doug Gilbert for doing a first version of this sense data
    conversion.

    reading the /proc/scsi/qla1280/* files can easily corrupt kernel memory.
    
    As the feature is deprecated, and the qla1280 implementation doesn't
    return very usefull implementation but is so buggy that any serious
    user would have noticed we just remove it.

    [PATCH] Fix selection of command serial numbers and pids
    
    This patch fixes one of Christroph's fixme comments in the SCSI midlayer.
    
    The selection of the serial number and pid for commands was done
    by a global variable and not SMP safe. The race was not very
    serious because it was only used for error handling, but it's
    still better to fix it.
    
    I audited all the drivers and none seemed to use them
    for anything interesting, so I just made it a per host counter
    protected by host lock.
    
    (in fact they could be probably removed because they only see
    to be used as a flag in exception handling and for debugging.
    The patch would be unfortunately quite big because a lot
    of driver printks use them)
    
    This should be slight faster on SMP too because the cache line of
    the counter won't bounce around the machine.

    [netdrvr mv643xx] Remove call to msleep() while locks are held.  We don't really need to
    wait for the link to come up.  It was a workaround to avoid a transient
    error message, "Virtual device %s asks to queue packet!\n", in
    dev_queue_xmit() when called by ic_bootp_send_if().  This happens because
    right after opening the network device, there is a pending PHY status
    change interrupt causing the driver to call netif_stop_queue().  A half
    second later, the link comes up and all is well.  We could have moved
    the call to msleep() to mv643xx_eth_open() to perpetuate the workaround,
    but I think it's best to remove it entirely.

    iocharset=none is an explicit option to specify the default

    remounting a partition which was mounted with a different setting,
    and allows the same mount options to be used between 2.6 and 2.4

    differences where I couldn't verify whether the in-kernel or
    the upstream version are correct, so I left them alone.

    Ok, that's a bug in PCIEPORTBUS.  Best is probably to
    completely remove the dependency, it doesn't make much sense
    (the code has to handle the case of mmconfig not being available at
    runtime anyways)
    
    Remove bogus dependency in PCI Express root driver.

    [ACPI] Add ACPI-based memory hot plug driver.
    
    The ACPI based memory hot plug driver patch supports physical hotplug
    operations on memory. This driver fields notifications for memory add
    and remove operations from firmware and notifies the VM of the affected
    memory ranges. Accordingly, this driver also maintains and updates the
    states of all the memory ranges. This driver is useful on hardware which
    helps firmware generating ACPI events for every physical hotplug
    operation of memory boards on the system during runtime.

    [IPV4]: Make loopback idev stick around.
    
    As it is when loopback_dev loses all of its IPv4 addresses its
    corresponding idev will be destroyed.  Unfortunately as of last
    August route.c relies on the loopback idev to kill references
    to other idev objects.
    
    The end result is that when you do ip a f dev lo, unregistering
    other devices will hang until those dst objects referring to
    their idev objects die of natural causes.  Of course this may
    never happen if the processes holding those references get
    dead-locked by invoking an operation that takes the RTNL.
    
    A simple solution is to make sure that loopback's idev sticks
    around all the time.
    
    Incidentally this also fixes the setting of some flags on the
    loopback idev object as currently the code that does it won't
    be called if you add the addresses to lo after bring it up.

    The basic classifier is the most simple classifier one can think of,
    it doesn't do anything on its own but to support extended matches and
    actions. A basic classifier returns true if no ematches or actions
    are configured and thus can also be used as a catch-all classifier.

    The meta ematch allows comparing various metadata values against

    supports various numeric meta values such as netfilter mark, packet
    length, security level, interface indices, tc classid, load average,
    a random value but also variable length values such as interface
    names. Adding support for additional meta values is as easy as
    writing a data collector (usually 1-5 lines of code) and assign it
    to a id and type by putting it into the meta operations table.

    [PKT_SCHED]: Simple comparison ematch (cmp)
    
    The cmp ematch compares a static value provided by userspace against
    a 8, 16, or 32bit chunk read from the packet. The reading offset is
    provided by userspace and based on one of the skb layers (mac|nh|h).
    The ematch provides functionality to transform the byte order of
    the chunk and/or apply a mask and understands the operands eq, lt,
    and gt. Basically, it is very similiar to the u32 (e)match but tries
    filling the gaps left behind.

    [PKT_SCHED]: Extended Matches API
    
    An extended match (ematch) is a small classifiction tool not worth
    writing a full classifier for. Ematches can be interconnected to form
    a logic expression and get attached to classifiers to extend their
    functionatlity.
    
    The userspace part transforms the logic expressions into an array
    consisting of multiple sequences of interconnected ematches separated
    by markers. Precedence is implemented by a special ematch kind
    referencing a sequence beyond the marker of the current sequence
    causing the current position in the sequence to be pushed onto a stack
    to allow the current position to be overwritten by the position
    referenced in the special ematch. Matching continues in the new sequence
    until a marker is reached causing the position to be restored from the
    stack.

    EMU10K1/EMU10K2 driver
    This patch provides better sync between multiple voices by separating

    this should not make much of a difference but will be important for
    minimizing phase error between voices for multichannel PCM.

    [ALSA] add 96Khz support and setting sample rate for	direct SPDIF output
    
    EMU10K1/EMU10K2 driver
    This patch should add support for 96Khz 'direct SPDIF' aka 'SPDIF
    Bypass' (not P16V) playback mode available on the Audigy1 and 2 and
    newer SBLives (?).  It lets you bypass the 48khz DSP resampling when
    using the card in digital mode.  It also adds 96khz analog playback
    support, good for testing but less interesting because it's downsampled
    to 48khz.  A new mixer control 'Audigy SPDIF Output Sample Rate' is
    created, you can choose 44100, 48000, or 96000.  Standard SPDIF
    playback, AC3 passthrough (real 96khz playback), and analog playback
    (96khz is resampled to 48khz in the DSP) all work with a 16 bit,96khz
    wav file.  Only the last was tested due to lack of any SPDIF hardware.
    
    This was derived mostly from the opensource.creative.com driver.  All
    that was needed for 96khz playback to work in analog mode was changing
    the format to 8000_96000 (looks like the creative driver supports 192khz
    too).  And, of course this sample rate has always been supported (albeit
    downsampled) because if you have 48khz samples in a soundfont the
    envelope engine has to be able to pitch shift them in both directions.
    
    I still have not been able to figure out how to get 24 bit playback to
    work.  This is possible, independent of the P16V, for spdif and analog
    24/48 playback via the DSP.  I do know how to access the full 24 bits
    from the ADC from within the DSP, just not how to get it in there.  For
    one thing I have no idea which 24 bit format it supports.  Some of them
    seemed to work with JACK but produced noise.
    
    This was generated with my multichannel patch but it applies against
    ALSA CVS as well.

    This patch changes the emu10k1 multichannel capture device (hw:x,2) to

    setting the corresponding FXWC bits by default.
    
    This allows capturing multiple inputs simultaneously.  It completely
    bypasses the capture controls of the mixer.  With my Audigy2 ZS I can

    [ALSA] HDSP fixes
    
    Documentation,RME HDSP driver
    * init sequence cleanup and firmware upload related bugfixes
    * more robust revision detection scheme
      (should transparently handle new revisions)
    * allow hdsploader and the kernel fw loader to coexist
      this is useful for cardbus user who compiled the driver in-kernel
      (userspace may not be ready to upload the firmware when the card
       is probed)
    * removed confusing and obsolete passthru option (was interfering
      with the mixer when opening the device for capture or playback)
      this change requires a recompile of the userspace tools against
      the patched hdsp.h
    * removed confusing and obsolete line_outs_monitor module param
    * made precise_ptr the default behaviour, and runtime tweakable
      (removed corresponding module param)
    * add an alsa ctl to disable the use of the midi tasklet, and
      process midi data in the interrupt handler
      (using the tasklet is still the default)
      this is mainly intended for users of Ingo Molnar's RT patch
    * metering fix for Multiface/Digiface users (closes ALSA BUG #0000801)
    * small endianness fix
    * ALSA-Configuration.txt HDSP entry update
    * error messages cleanup

    [PATCH] sundance: attempt to address high irqs due to TX overflow
    
    In at least some versions of Kernel 2.6 (2.6.8.1, 2.6.11-rc2)
    the driver drivers/net/sundance.c creates high interrupt load
    (~ 100 interrupts per second) even in case of no network traffic
    at all.
    
    It seems that some sort of TX overflow handling is misplaced
    and triggers interrupts very often even in case of no data to
    send. The TX overflow handling has been moved to a more
    appropriate place.
    
    While there, an off by one error of reading the TX status has
    also been corrected by moving the read after the break.
    
    Thanks to Jeroen who tested the patch (also with high workload).
    Interrupts are down to normal and there are no obvious side
    effects.

    This patch updates the very-outdated Kconfig description for bonding.
    Users reading the help text in menuconfig or xconfig would see text that
    implied that bonding only supports static link aggregation, and required a
    specific switch to make it work.  The new description mentions multiple
    bonding modes and points the user to the bonding.txt documentation.

    same code. Patch is compile-tested.

    [IPV6]: match TCP port selection behavior with ipv4
    
    This patch makes TCP over IPV6 select ports the same way the current
    TCPv4 code does. It uses a hash function to provide a starting offset
    and a free running counter to provide seed.
    
    This changes the port selection semantics to match TCPv4 as well.
    If the port is in use but to a different remote address, it will get
    reused. It looks like the TCPv6 code was not updated when the TCPv4
    code changed. Now the code in ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c and ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c are
    almost identical for tcp_hash_connect.

    the controllers stop working and cpu usage gets high. The attached patch
    (against 2.6.11-rc3) corrects this bug by checking the information read
    from the controller. If the message length is bigger than the maximum
    possible, then it means the controller is not there and therefore this
    value should be discarded.
    
    Note that this is a re-send of a previous patch now that the patch of
    Peter (which had to be applied before this one) has been intregrated in
    the vanilla kernel. It's Peter's version modified to apply cleanly
    against 2.6.11-rc3 plus a fix in the comment.

    [PATCH] PCI: Dynids - passing driver data
    
    Currently, code exists in the pci layer to allow userspace to specify
    driver data when adding a pci dynamic id from sysfs. However, this data
    is never used and there exists no way in the existing code to use it.
    This patch allows device drivers to indicate that they want driver data
    passed to them on dynamic id adds by initializing use_driver_data in their
    pci_driver->pci_dynids struct. The documentation has also been updated
    to reflect this.

    [PATCH] arch/i386/kernel/pci/irq.c:  Wrong message output
    
    The following has been reported in the wild for kernel 2.6.8-24:
    
    PCI: Enabling device 0000:00:05.0 (0000 -> 0002)
    PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin @ of device 0000:00:05.0. Probably
    buggy MP table.
    
    It should read "No IRQ known for interrupt pin A", but the 'pin'
    variable has already been decremented (from 1 to 0), so the line:
    
    printk(KERN_WARNING "PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin %c of device
    %s.%s\n", 'A' + pin - 1, dev->slot_name, msg);
    
    causes "pin @" to be output, because 'A' + 0 - 1 == '@'.
    
    The supplied patch should fix it.  It also removes a redundant check for
    a nonzero pin.

    [PATCH] PCI: pci_raw_ops should use unsigned args
    
    Convert pci_raw_ops to use unsigned segment (aka domain),
    bus, and devfn.  With the previous code, various ia64 config
    accesses fail due to segment sign-extension problems.
    
    ia64:
        - With a signed seg >= 0x8, unwanted sign-extension occurs when
          "seg << 28" is cast to u64 in PCI_SAL_EXT_ADDRESS()
        - PCI_SAL_EXT_ADDRESS(): cast to u64 *before* shifting; otherwise
          "seg << 28" is evaluated as unsigned int (32 bits) and gets
          truncated when seg > 0xf
        - pci_sal_read(): validate "value" ptr as other arches do
        - pci_sal_{read,write}(): return -EINVAL rather than SAL error status

    __devinit, so pci_claim_resource() needs to be __devinit too.

    [PATCH] PCI: pci_proc_domain
    
    There's no need for the architectures to know how to name busses,
    so replace pci_name_bus with pci_proc_domain -- a predicate to allow
    architectures to choose whether domains are included in /proc/bus/pci
    or not.  I've converted all architectures but only tested ia64 and a
    CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS=n build.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: Remove unneeded instructions from ibmphp_pci.c
    
    this patch removes some unneeded code from ibmphp_pci.c. First I thought it
    is a bug and the second line should have been "sec_no = (int) sec_number".
    But than I found exactly the same read only 9 lines higher and after it the
    line I expected the second one to be. Between the 2 pci_bus_read_config_byte's
    are only some checks so I don't expect them to return different results. And
    sec_no is and int so removing this wont change anything at all.

    I have a buggy USB HID device (APC SmartUPS) in which the designers
    forgot that ReportCount is a global item. Consequently, according to the
    report descriptor, several reports have multiple copies of the same
    usage in each field. When you actually query the device, however, only a
    single copy of the usage is returned. hid-core catches the expected vs.
    actual length mismatch and fails the transfer. This effectively makes
    the buggy reports inaccessible even though enough data is present to
    populate one usage (which is all userspace wants anyway).
    
    This patch changes hid-core to only warn (if debug is enabled) on such
    reports rather than failing the transfer.

    [PATCH] ata_pci_remove_one used freed memory
    
    	Attempting to unload a serial ATA driver module gave me a kernel
    memory fault.  I think this problem occurs in all configurations, but
    I should mention that my configuration may be slightly unusual in that
    I configured my BIOS not to do IDE emulation with SATA disks, and I don't
    actually have any disks plugged in.
    
    	The problem was that ata_pci_remove_one would call
    scsi_host_put(ap->host), which would free the memory used to hold
    host_set->ports, but host_set->ports was used later in ata_pci_remove_one.
    
    	So, the following patch reorders some of the steps in
    ata_pci_remove_one and seems to eliminate the problem, at least to
    the extent that I can unload and reload the module, although I do not
    have a SATA disk handy for testing (I'm expecting one to arrive later
    today).
    
    	The patch actually makes the code four lines shorter, although
    two of those lines come from putting an assignement and variable
    declaration in the same line.  Since the patch is a little hard to
    read, here is a description of the edit steps.
    
    	1. Moved pci_release_regions() to toward the end of the routine
    to facilitate merging the loops before and after it.  Also, I think that
    calls that are good candidates for consolidating into the bus-level code
    in the future (instead of individual drivers) are best put at the beginning
    or end of the driver routines so that it is clearer if there would be
    problems doing such consolidation.
    
    	2. Moved the cacluation of ioaddr into the only if-branch that
    uses it.
    
    	3. Moved the call to scsi_host_put to after the code that
    checks ATA_FLAG_NO_LEGACY.

    To fix this problem, this patch enables hardware tapping and converts
    the resulting tap and gesture bits to standard finger pressure values
    (z), which is what mousedev.c and the userspace X driver expects.

    reason, the smallest possible wheel movement is reported as a scroll
    amount of 4 units.  This amount is typically spread out over more than
    one packet, so the driver has to accumulate scroll delta values to
    correctly deal with this.

    [PATCH] use datacs in smc91x driver
    
    From: Ian Campbell <icampbell@arcom.com>
    
    Below is a patch to support the second 32-bit DATACS chipselect in the
    smc91x driver to transfer data.  Support is enabled by adding a resource to
    the platform device named 'smc91x-data32'.
    
    My platform has a 16-bit chip select for the primary IO region and no DMA.
    I found that throughput went from roughly 50mbit/s to 80mbit/s.  I tested
    by throwing UDP packets at it using mgen (9000 packets/second with UDP
    payload of 1472 bytes is roughly 100mbit/s, I think) and counting the
    packets received in 60s, I then did the same for transmitting.  The
    measurements are very rough but the improvement seems fairly significant to
    me.
    
    Patch was compiled for lubbock and neponset and compiled and tested on my
    PXA platform.

    [PATCH] smc91x: allow RX of VLAN packets
    
    This patch allows for VLAN packets to be received.  The initial patch
    was from Andrew de Quincey.
    
    While there, it also adds a test against an impossible hardware state
    in theory but that happened in practice where the chip returns a
    packet length of 0 which, once the status words have been substracted,
    causes the transfer of data with a negative length.  Flaky hardware is
    probably to blame here but better guard ourselves against that than
    crashing the kernel.  David Brownell was the happy victim of such hw.

    [PATCH] kbuild: skip depmod if not executable
    
    I've cross-compiled Linux on i386-netbsdelf2.0 for
    arm-linux for quite some time now and everything seems
    to be working perfectly except for one minor glitch in
    the build process that halts module installation
    (needlessly, IMHO). Specifically, if System.map exists
    $(DEPMOD) is run ("for convenience" as the comment
    says in the Makefile). However, on NetBSD I don't have
    $(DEPMOD) available so the command fails and make
    exits with non-zero exit status. Please consider the
    attached patch to add a check for $(DEPMOD) so that
    missing $(DEPMOD) won't halt the whole build process.

    [PATCH] kbuild: fix for i386 cross compile
    
    I used to be be able to cross compile for i386 on my x86_64 machine,
    but recently something (gcc/binutils?) changed, and it stopped working.
    
    Following patch makes cross compile work with:
    
    make ARCH=i386 CFLAGS_KERNEL="-m32" AFLAGS_KERNEL="-m32" bzImage
    
    Without the patch I'm getting the following error:

    [PATCH] kbuild: no redundant srctree in tags file
    
    Avoid cluttering the tags/TAGS generated file with $(srctree) in the paths
    if this is not needed.
    
    This has two advantages:
    
    - Saving about 20M on the size of the resulting tags file (which are used
      currently to store the absolute path of the file names rather than the
      relative one) when KBUILD_OUTPUT is not set.
    
    - Keeping the tags file valid when the directory is renamed.
    
    No change is done for who does make tags O=..., if this is wanted (I would
    find that incommodous and non-typical for a developer, but anyway I've not
    ruined functionality in that case).

    [PATCH] kbuild: Use -Wno-pointer-sign for gcc 4.0
    
    Compiling an allyesconfig kernel straight with a gcc 4.0 snapshot
    gives nearly 10k new warnings like:
    
    warning: pointer targets in passing argument 5 of `cpuid' differ in signedness
    
    Since the sheer number of these warnings was too much even for the
    most determined kernel janitors (I actually asked ;-) and I don't
    think it's a very serious issue to have these mismatches I submitted
    an new option to gcc to disable it. It was incorporated in gcc mainline
    now.
    
    This patch makes the kernel compilation use it. There are still
    quite a lot of new warnings with 4.0 (mostly about uninitialized variables),
    but the compile log looks much nicer nnow.

    The wrong version of the parmtype patch was merged, incompletely, and
    the part that got merged got broken on the way.  Here are the fixes:
    
    Move __MODULE_INFO to modparam.h: This macro is used in modparam.h;
    there are users who include this header but not module.h.  The latter
    includes modparam.h already.
    
    __MODULE_INFO(parmtype, name##type, #name ":" #type) does not evaluate
    to __MODULE_INFO(parmtype, footype, "foo:int") as was the idea, but to
    __MODULE_INFO(parmtype, fooint, "foo:int") when type is bound to int.
    In more complicated cases, we get syntax erros.  Re-introduce the
    __MODULE_PARM_TYPE macro; this is cleaner than renaming the type parameter.
    
    Add the parmtype definition which was dropped during the merge to to the
    obsolete but still heavily used MODULE_PARM macro.

    Damien Douxchamps:
    
    I have tested and updated a patch from Randy Dunlap that fixes missing
    entries in the modules.ieee1394map file. The patch is against latest SVN
    (1234).
    
    The patch adds the following entries for IIDC cameras that would not be
    detected otherwise:
    
    video1394            0x0000000c  0x000000  0x000000 0x00a02d     0x000101
    video1394            0x0000000c  0x000000  0x000000 0x00a02d     0x000102
    raw1394              0x0000000c  0x000000  0x000000 0x00a02d     0x000101
    raw1394              0x0000000c  0x000000  0x000000 0x00a02d     0x000102
    
    This is necessary because the IIDC consortium interpreted the 1394
    specifications differently. They have been summoned by the 1394TA to
    change their numbering policy so that these entries are final and will
    not grow forever in number.

    This patch makes sure we check the return value of copy_to_user() in

    silencing this warning:

    drivers/ieee1394/raw1394.c:446: warning: ignoring return value of `__copy_to_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
    
    I've submitted this before, but never got an ACK or NACK, and the patch is

    kbuild: Warn when building external modules without modversions
    
    This adds a warning when building external modules (M= or SUBDIRS=
    syntax) and there is no Module.symvers in the object tree. A missing
    Module.symvers is a clear sign that the kernel tree itself was never
    compiled. The resulting modules will work, but no symbol version
    information will be attached to kernel symbols the module uses (because
    that information comes from Module.symvers), and so the module will be
    more unsafe.
    Futhermore the external module will not record what other modules it is
    depended on.
    
    The test works with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled or disabled.

    If INSTALL_PATH is set one the commanline to make like this:
    make INSTALL_PATH=/nfs/boot install

    kbuild: Introdude KBUILD_NOCMDDEP
    
    When tossing around with different gcc compilers there is no way to tell kbuild
    to ignore the new name of the compiler. The new option KBUILD_NOCMDDEP tell
    kbuild not to check the commandline for changes.
    This should be used with care because the resulting kernel may become inconsistent
    if one part is build with 2.96, and another part build with 3.3.4.
    So use only when you know what you are doing.
    
    Syntax:
    make KBUILD_NOCMDDEP=1
    
    Original request for this feature came from hpa.

    [PATCH] net/cosa: replace schedule_timeout() with msleep()
    
    Hi,
    
    Description: Use msleep() instead of schedule_timeout() to guarantee the task
    delays as expected. Also uses the set_current_state() macro instead of direct
    assignment in a pair of spots. I am still concerned about those sleeps, as
    TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE() is used without any checking for signals. Hence I used
    msleep() for the longer delay. Perhaps the 30 jiffy delay has not been
    updated for the larger HZ values and thus could be changed to msleep(300).

    [DECNET] Don't use sk_protinfo + private sock slab cache
    
    DecNET already uses a private sock slab cache, but initializes sk->sk_protinfo,
    pointing to (sk + 1), this is wrong because at sk_free time we call
    sk->sk_destruct, that by default points to sock_def_destruct, that does a kfree
    on sk->sk_protinfo, since it was initialized at net_proto_family->create() time
    (dn_create), but in decnet sk_protinfo was not kmalloced, it was allocated
    piggybacked to struct sock.
    
    This doesn't causes problems because decnet sets sk->sk_destruct to a custom
    function that doesn't calls kfree(sk->sk_protinfo), but to reach a long time
    goal of killing sk_protinfo lets just make DN_SK return sk + 1.
    
    I left merging dn_scp with dn_sock for later, as the current state suits my
    needs to introduce connection_sock.

    With this we can have aggregate protocol specific struct proto_sock
    allocated for non performance critical protocols.
    
    We still check for slab == NULL && zero_it == 1 to allocate from the
    generic "sock" slab cache, but this will be removed when all the
    network families stop using sk_protinfo, when the generic "sock"

    JFS: replace schedule_timeout() with msleep()
    
    Use msleep() instead of schedule_timeout() to guarantee the task
    delays as expected. The current code uses TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
    however, it does not check for signals, so I do not think the
    change to msleep() is necessarily bad.

    [CIFS] get rid of tcp peek usage on cifs socket. Makes more sense to read normally
    first four bytes off the socket (then read the rest of the frame) rather than peek
    first few bytes then read because we were having to retry the peek multiple times
    when peek would return less than four bytes and four bytes is the minimum we
    ever get.

    [netdrvr mv643xx] This patch adds device driver model support to the mv643xx_eth driver.
    
    This is a change to the driver's programming interface.  Platform
    code must now pass in the address of the MV643xx ethernet registers
    and IRQ.  If firmware doesn't set the MAC address, platform code
    must also pass in the MAC address.
    
    Also, note that local MV_READ/MV_WRITE macros are used rather than              using global macros.  Keeping the macro names minimizes the patch size.         The names will be changed to mv_read/mv_write in a later cosmetic               cleanup patch.

    When cfq I/O scheduler is selected, get_request() in __make_request() calls
    __cfq_get_queue().  __cfq_get_queue() finds an existing queue (struct
    cfq_queue) of the current process for the device and returns it.  If it's not
    found, __cfq_get_queue() creates and returns a new one if __cfq_get_queue() is
    called with __GFP_WAIT flag, or __cfq_get_queue() returns NULL (this means that
    get_request() fails) if no __GFP_WAIT flag.
    
    On the other hand, in __make_request(), get_request() is called without
    __GFP_WAIT flag at the first time.  Thus, the get_request() fails when there is
    no existing queue, typically when it's called for the first I/O request of the
    process to the device.
    
    Though it will be followed by get_request_wait() for general case,
    __make_request() will just end the I/O with an error (EWOULDBLOCK) when the
    request was for read-ahead.

    The ELF core dump code has one use of off_t when writing out segments.
    Some of the segments may be passed the 2GB limit of an off_t, even on a
    32-bit system, so it's important to use loff_t instead.  This fixes a

    [PATCH] sbp2 slab corruption fix
    
    This fixed a problem that showed up in the Fedora development tree a few
    weeks before the Fedora Core 4 release, initially as slab corruption, later
    as hard crashes on boot up, when slab debugging was disabled for the
    release.  More details on the history at
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=158424
    
    The problem is caused by sbp2's use of scsi_host->hostdata[0] to hold a
    scsi_id, without explicitly requesting space for it.  Since hostdata is
    declared as a zero-sized array, we don't get any such space by default, so
    it must be explicitly requested.  The patch below implements just that.

     This patch fixes q->unplug_thresh condition check in
    __elv_add_request().  rq.count[READ] + rq.count[WRITE] can increase
    more than one if another thread has allocated a request after the
    current request is allocated or in_flight could have changed resulting
    in larger-than-one change of nrq, thus breaking the threshold
    mechanism.

    [PATCH] Fix PCI BAR size interpretation on 64-bit arches
    
    On 64-bit machines, PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_MASK and other mask constants
    passed to pci_size() are 64-bit (for example ~0x0fUL).  However, pci_size
    does comparisons between the u32 arguments and the mask, which will fail
    even though any result from pci_size is still just 32-bit.
    
    Changing the mask argument to u32 seems the obvious thing to do, since all
    arithmetic in the function is 32-bit and having a larger mask makes no
    sense.
    
    This triggered on a PPC64 system here where an adapter (VGA, as it
    happened) had a memory region base of 0xfe000000 and a sz of the same,
    matching the if (max == maxbase ...) test at the bottom of pci_size but
    failing the mask comparison.  Quite a corner case which I guess explains
    why we haven't seen it until now.

    [IPV4]: Sysctl configurable icmp error source address.
    
    This patch alows you to change the source address of icmp error
    messages. It applies cleanly to 2.6.11.11 and retains the default
    behaviour.
    
    In the old (default) behaviour icmp error messages are sent with the ip
    of the exiting interface.
    
    The new behaviour (when the sysctl variable is toggled on), it will send
    the message with the ip of the interface that received the packet that
    caused the icmp error. This is the behaviour network administrators will
    expect from a router. It makes debugging complicated network layouts
    much easier. Also, all 'vendor routers' I know of have the later
    behaviour.

    [IPv6] Don't generate temporary for TUN devices
    
    Userland layer-2 tunneling devices allocated through the TUNTAP driver
    (drivers/net/tun.c) have a type of ARPHRD_NONE, and have no link-layer
    address. The kernel complains at regular interval when IPv6 Privacy
    extension are enabled because it can't find an hardware address :
    
    Dec 29 11:02:04 auguste kernel: __ipv6_regen_rndid(idev=cb3e0c00):
    cannot get EUI64 identifier; use random bytes.
    
    IPv6 Privacy extensions should probably be disabled on that sort of
    device. They won't work anyway. If userland wants a more usual
    Ethernet-ish interface with usual IPv6 autoconfiguration, it will use a
    TAP device with an emulated link-layer  and a random hardware address
    rather than a TUN device.
    
    As far as I could fine, TUN virtual device from TUNTAP is the very only
    sort of device using ARPHRD_NONE as kernel device type.

    [IPV6]: Ensure to use icmpv6_socket in non-preemptive context.
    
    We saw following trace several times:
    
    |BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000001] code: httpd/30137
    |caller is icmpv6_send+0x23/0x540
    | [<c01ad63b>] smp_processor_id+0x9b/0xb8
    | [<c02993e7>] icmpv6_send+0x23/0x540
    
    This is because of icmpv6_socket, which is the only one user of
    smp_processor_id() in icmpv6_send(), AFAIK.
    
    Since it should be used in non-preemptive context,
    let's defer the dereference after disabling preemption
    (by icmpv6_xmit_lock()).

    [PATCH] spin longer for ehci port reset completion
    
    This makes the EHCI driver spin a bit longer before concluding that the
    port reset failed.  "Obviously safe."
    
    It allows some devices to enumerate that previously didn't.  We've seen
    a bunch of these problem reports recently, this will make some go away.
    
    As reported by Michael Zapf <Michael.Zapf@uni-kassel.de>, some EHCI
    controllers seem to take forever to finish port resets and produce
    "port N reset error -110" type errors.  Spinning a bit longer helps.

    [PATCH] ARM: 2709/1: Systems with PCMCIA should also see IDE options (for CompactFlash memories)
    
    Patch from David Brownell
    
    The ARM generic Kconfig filters out IDE options ... except for
    an error prone ARMload of special cases.
    This adds one general case to the systems that will offer IDE options:
    kernels with PCMCIA support, which probably want to use IDE to access
    CompactFlash cards.  This might allow many (most?) of the other cases
    to disappear, for systems that only see IDE hardware through CF cards.
    Right now this one patch is used to gate access to CF cards, including
    MicroDrives, for both omap_cf and at91_cf drivers.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix nasty sleep/wakeup problem
    
    Despite all the care lately in making the powermac sleep/wakeup as
    robust as possible, there is still a nasty related to the use of cpufreq
    on PMU based machines.  Unfortunately, it affects paulus old powerbook
    so I have to fix it :)
    
    We didn't manage to understand what is precisely going on, it leads to
    memory corruption and might have to do with RAM not beeing properly
    refreshed when a cpufreq transition is done right before the sleep.
    
    The best workaround (and less intrusive at this point) we could come up
    with is included in this patch.  We basically do _not_ force a switch to
    high speed on suspend anymore (that is what is causing the problem) on
    those machines.  We still force a speed switch on wakeup (since we don't
    know what speed we are coming back from sleep at, and that seems to work
    fine).
    
    Since, during this short interval, the actual CPU speed might be
    incorrect, we also hack around by multiplying loops_per_jiffy by 2 (max
    speed factor on those machines) during early wakeup stage to make sure
    udelay's during that time aren't too short.
    
    For after 2.6.12, we'll change udelay implementation to use the CPU
    timebase (which is always constant) instead like we do on ppc64 and thus
    get rid of all those problems.

    [PATCH] iseries_veth: Supress spurious WARN_ON() at module unload
    
    My patch from a few weeks back (now in mainline), called "Cleanup skbs to
    prevent unregister_netdevice() hanging", can cause our TX timeout code to
    fire on machines with lots of VLANs (because it takes > 2 seconds between
    when we stop the queues and when we're finished stopping the connections).
    
    When that happens the TX timeout code freaks out and does a WARN_ON()
    because as far as it's concerned there shouldn't be a TX timeout happening,
    which is fair enough.
    
    I have a "proper" fix for this, which is to a) do refcounting on
    connections and b) implement a proper ack timer so we don't keep unacked
    skbs lying around for ever.  But for 2.6.12 I propose just supressing the
    WARN_ON().  Users will still see the "NETDEV WATCHDOG" warning, but that's
    not nearly as bad as a WARN_ON() which users interpret as an Oops.

    [PATCH] PCI: MSI functionality broken on Serverworks GC chipset
    
    MSI functionality is broken on the GC_LE x86 chipset that Serverworks
    developed and that is being used in various platforms today. Broadcom is
    going to push out to the kernel MSI enabled Gigabit drivers (in the very
    near future), and we would like to make sure that MSI does not get
    enabled on any platforms using the GC_LE chipset (device id 0x17).
    Following the AMD 8131 example, I am including a patch to disable MSI
    functionality when a GCNB_LE is detected. Please let me know if there
    are any issues with this. This is a permanent fix for this chipset, as
    the hardware will not be updated.

    [PATCH] USB: ftdi_sio: avoid losing received data in tty-ldisc
    
    ftdi_sio: Avoid losing bytes at tty-ldisc.
    
    This patch was originally developed by Daniel Smertnig.  I
    (Ian Abbott) made a few changes.  It has been tested by both
    Daniel and I, at least for raw, non-canonical receive data
    processing.
    
    Here is Daniel's original description of the patch:
    
    ===
    During a project in which I was using a FTDI 232BM to
    transmit data at relative high speeds (625kBit/s), I
    noticed a problem where data was lost even if flow
    control was enabled: The FTDI-Driver receives 512 Bytes
    of data over USB at a time, which consists of 8 64-Byte
    packets. Subtracting the 2 bytes of status information
    included in each packet this gives 496 "real" data
    bytes per read.
    
    This data is passed (indirectly, via the flip buffers)
    to the tty line discipline which takes care of
    throttling when there the free buffer space reaches
    TTY_THRESHOLD_THROTTLE (128). Because the FTDI driver
    processes up to 496 bytes at a time, throttling won't
    happen in time and the line discipline will discard the
    remaining bytes.
    
    To avoid this the patch passes data in 62-byte blocks
    to the tty layer and checks the available space in the
    ldisc-buffers. If there isn't enough free space,
    processing the rest of the data is delayed using a
    workqueue.
    
    Note: The original problem should be easily
    reproducible with a userspace program which does slow &
    small reads.

    [PATCH] USB: fix ub issues
    
    This smoothes two imperfections:
    - Increase number of LUNs per device from 4 to 9. The best solution
      would be to remove this limit altogether, but that has to wait until
      the time when more than 26 hosts are allowed.
    - Replace mdelay with msleep in a probing routine.

    [PATCH] sg traverse fix for __atapi_pio_bytes()
    
    Problem:
    Incorrect md5sum when using ATAPI PIO mode to verify a distro CD.
    
    Root cause:  sg traverse problem.
    In __atapi_pio_bytes(), if qc->cursg++ is increased and "goto
    next_page" is executed, then sg is not updated to the new qc->cursg
    and the old sg is overwritten with the new data.
    
    Changes:
    - Replace "goto next_page" with "goto next_sg" to make sg updated.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix PER_LINUX32 behaviour
    
    This patch fixes some bugs in the ppc64 PER_LINUX32 implementation,
    noted by Juergen Kreileder:
    
    * uname(2) doesn't respect PER_LINUX32, it returns 'ppc64' instead of 'ppc'
    * Child processes of a PER_LINUX32 process don't inherit PER_LINUX32
    
    Along the way I took the opportunity to move things around so that
    sys_ppc32.c only has 32-bit syscall emulation functions and to remove
    the obsolete "fakeppc" command line option.

    [PATCH] ia64: fix floating-point preemption problem
    
    There've been reports of problems with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y and the high
    floating point partition.  This is caused by the possibility of preemption
    and rescheduling on a different processor while saving or restioirng the
    high partition.
    
    The only places where the FPU state is touched are in ptrace, in
    switch_to(), and where handling a floating-point exception.  In switch_to()
    preemption is off.  So it's only in trap.c and ptrace.c that we need to
    prevent preemption.
    
    Here is a patch that adds commentary to make the conditions clear, and adds
    appropriate preempt_{en,dis}able() calls to make it so.  In trap.c I use
    preempt_enable_no_resched(), as we're about to return to user space where
    the preemption flag will be checked anyway.

    [PATCH] uml: fix strace -f
    
    It turns out that we need to check for pending signals when a newly forked
    process is run for the first time.  With strace -f, strace needs to know about
    the forked process before it gets going.  If it doesn't, then it ptraces some
    bogus values into its registers, and the process segfaults.  So, I added calls
    to interrupt_end, which does that, plus checks for reschedules.  There
    shouldn't be any of those, but x86 does the same thing, so I'm copying that
    behavior to be safe.

    [PATCH] NFS: Fix lookup intent handling
    
    We should never apply a lookup intent to anything other than the last
    path component in an open(), create() or access() call.
    
    Introduce the helper nfs_lookup_check_intent() which always returns
    zero if LOOKUP_CONTINUE or LOOKUP_PARENT are set, and returns the
    intent flags if we're on the last component of the lookup.
    By doing so, we fix a bug in open(O_EXCL), where we may end up
    optimizing away a real lookup of the parent directory.

    [PATCH] Replace check_bridge_mode() with (bridge->mode & AGSTAT_MODE_3_0).
    
    [AGPGART] Replace check_bridge_mode() with (bridge->mode & AGSTAT_MODE_3_0).
    
    As mentioned earlier, the current check_bridge_mode() code assumes
    that AGP bridges are PCI devices.  This isn't always true.  Definitely
    not for HP zx1 chipset and the same seems to be the case for SGI's AGP
    bridge.
    
    The patch below fixes the problem by picking up the AGP_MODE_3_0 bit
    from bridge->mode.  I feel like I may be missing something, since I
    can't see any reason why check_bridge_mode() wasn't doing that in the
    first place.  According to the AGP 3.0 specs, the AGP_MODE_3_0 bit is
    determined during the hardware reset and cannot be changed, so it
    seems to me it should be safe to pick it up from bridge->mode.
    
    With the patch applied, I can definitely use AGP acceleration both
    with AGP 2.0 and AGP 3.0 (one with an Nvidia card, the other with an
    ATI FireGL card).
    
    Unless someone spots a problem, please apply this patch so 3d
    acceleration can work on zx1 boxes again.
    
    This makes AGP work again on machines with an AGP bridge that isn't a
    PCI device.

    [PATCH] AGP fix for Xen VMM
    
    When Linux is running on the Xen virtual machine monitor, physical
    addresses are virtualised and cannot be directly referenced by the AGP
    GART.  This patch fixes the GART driver for Xen by adding a layer of
    abstraction between physical addresses and 'GART addresses'.
    
    Architecture-specific functions are also defined for allocating and freeing
    the GATT.  Xen requires this to ensure that table really is contiguous from
    the point of view of the GART.
    
    These extra interface functions are defined as 'no-ops' for all existing
    architectures that use the GART driver.

    [TG3] Fix link failure in 5701
    
    On some 5701 devices with older bootcode, the LED configuration bits in
    SRAM may be invalid with value zero. The fix is to check for invalid
    bits (0) and default to PHY 1 mode. Incorrect LED mode will lead to
    error in programming the PHY.
    
    Thanks to Grant Grundler for debugging the problem.
    
    >From Grant:
    | In May, 2004,  tg3 v3.4 changed how MAC_LED_CTRL (0x40c) was getting
    | programmed and how to determine what to program into LED_CTRL. The new
    | code trusted NIC_SRAM_DATA_CFG (0x00000b58) to indicate what to write
    | to LED_CTRL and MII EXT_CTRL registers. On "IOX Core Lan", SRAM was

    [PATCH] namei fixes (15/19)
    
    Getting rid of sloppy logics:
    
    a) in do_follow_link() we have the wrong vfsmount dropped if our symlink
    had been mounted on something.  Currently it worls only because we never
    get such situation (modulo filesystem playing dirty tricks on us).  And
    it obfuscates already convoluted logics...
    
    b) same goes for open_namei().
    
    c) in __link_path_walk() we have another "it should never happen" sloppiness -
    out_dput: there does double-free on underlying vfsmount and leaks the covering
    one if we hit it just after crossing a mountpoint.  Again, wrong vfsmount

    [PATCH] namei fixes (13/19)
    
    In open_namei() exit_dput: we have mntput() done in the wrong order -
    if nd->mnt != path.mnt we end up doing
    	mntput(nd->mnt);
    	nd->mnt = path.mnt;
    	dput(nd->dentry);
    	mntput(nd->mnt);
    which drops nd->dentry too late.  Fixed by having path.mnt go first.
    That allows to switch O_NOFOLLOW under if (__follow_mount(...)) back
    to exit_dput, while we are at it.
    
    Fix for early-mntput() race + equivalent transformation.

    [PATCH] namei fixes (10/19)
    
    In open_namei(), __follow_down() loop turned into __follow_mount().
    Instead of
    	if we are on a mountpoint dentry
    		if O_NOFOLLOW checks fail
    			drop path.dentry
    			drop nd
    			return
    		do equivalent of follow_mount(&path.mnt, &path.dentry)
    		nd->mnt = path.mnt
    we do
    	if __follow_mount(path) had, indeed, traversed mountpoint
    		/* now both nd->mnt and path.mnt are pinned down */
    		if O_NOFOLLOW checks fail
    			drop path.dentry
    			drop path.mnt
    			drop nd
    			return
    		mntput(nd->mnt)
    		nd->mnt = path.mnt
    
    Now __follow_down() can be folded into follow_down() - no other callers left.
    We need to reorder dput()/mntput() there - same problem as in follow_mount().
    
    Equivalent transformation + fix for a bug in O_NOFOLLOW handling - we used to
    get -ELOOP if we had the same fs mounted on /foo and /bar, had something bound
    on /bar/baz and tried to open /foo/baz with O_NOFOLLOW.  And fix of

    [PATCH] namei fixes (9/19)
    
    New helper: __follow_mount(struct path *path).  Same as follow_mount(), except
    that we do *not* do mntput() after the first lookup_mnt().
    
    IOW, original path->mnt stays pinned down.  We also take care to do dput()
    before mntput() in the loop body (follow_mount() also needs that reordering,
    but that will be done later in the series).
    
    The following are equivalent, assuming that path.mnt == x:
    (1)
    	follow_mount(&path.mnt, &path.dentry)
    (2)
    	__follow_mount(&path);
    	if (path->mnt != x)
    		mntput(x);
    (3)
    	if (__follow_mount(&path))

    Callers of follow_mount() in __link_path_walk() converted to (2).

    [PATCH] namei fixes (6/19)
    
    mntget(path->mnt) in do_follow_link() moved down to right before the
    __do_follow_link() call and rigth after loop: resp.
    
    dput()+mntput() on non-ELOOP branch moved up to right after __do_follow_link()
    call.
    
    resulting
    loop:
    	mntget(path->mnt);
    	path_release(nd);
    	dput(path->mnt);
    	mntput(path->mnt);
    replaced with equivalent
    	dput(path->mnt);
    	path_release(nd);
    
    Equivalent transformations - the reason why we have that mntget() is that
    __do_follow_link() can drop a reference to nd->mnt and that's what holds
    path->mnt.  So that call can happen at any point prior to __do_follow_link()
    touching nd->mnt.  The rest is obvious.
    
    NOTE: current tree relies on symlinks *never* being mounted on anything.  It's
    not hard to get rid of that assumption (actually, that will come for free
    later in the series).  For now we are just not making the situation worse than
    it is.

    do_link:.
    
    We set path.mnt to nd->mnt after path_lookup() and __do_follow_link().  In

    path.mnt immediately after that loop.

    OK, here comes a patch series that hopefully should close all

    Patches alread in the tree close only (very wide) races in following symlinks
    (see "busy inodes after umount" thread some time ago).  Unfortunately, quite a
    few narrower races of the same nature were not closed.  Hopefully this should

    [PATCH] s390: uml ptrace fixes
    
    To make UML build and run on s390, I needed to do these two little
    changes:
    
    1) UML includes some of the subarch's (s390) headers. I had to
       change one of them with the following one-liner, to make this
       compile. AFAICS, this change doesn't break compilation of s390
       itself.
    
    2) UML needs to intercept syscalls via ptrace to invalidate the syscall,
       read syscall's parameters and write the result with the result of
       UML's syscall processing. Also, UML needs to make sure, that the host
       does no syscall restart processing. On i386 for example, this can be
       done by writing -1 to orig_eax on the 2nd syscall interception
       (orig_eax is the syscall number, which after the interception is used
       as a "interrupt was a syscall" flag only.
       Unfortunately, s390 holds syscall number and syscall result in gpr2 and
       its "interrupt was a syscall" flag (trap) is unreachable via ptrace.
       So I changed the host to set trap to -1, if the syscall number is changed
       to an invalid value on the first syscall interception.

    [PATCH] s390: ptrace peek and poke
    
    The special cases of peek and poke on acrs[15] and the fpc register are not
    handled correctly.  A poke on acrs[15] will clobber the 4 bytes after the
    access registers in the thread_info structure.  That happens to be the kernel
    stack pointer.  A poke on the fpc with an invalid value is not caught by the
    validity check.  On the next context switch the broken fpc value will cause a
    program check in the kernel.  Improving the checks in peek and poke fixes
    this.

    [PATCH] mpage_end_io_write() I/O error handling fix
    
    When fsync() runs wait_on_page_writeback_range() it only inspects pages which
    are actually under I/O (PAGECACHE_TAG_WRITEBACK).  If a page completed I/O
    prior to wait_on_page_writeback_range() looking at it, it is supposed to have
    recorded its I/O error state in the address_space.
    
    But mpage_mpage_end_io_write() forgot to set the address_space error flag in
    this case.

    [PATCH] ARM: 2700/1: Disable IXP2000 IRQs at bootup
    
    Patch from Deepak Saxena
    
    The IXDP2800 bootloader does not disable IRQs before jumping into
    the kernel and this is causing the Grand Unified KGDB to crash
    the system when we do an early call to trap_init() and irq handlers
    have not yet been registered. This patch disables IRQs before we
    jump into the kernel.

    [PATCH] ARM: 2691/1: PXA27x sleep fixes take 2
    
    Patch from Todd Poynor
    
    PXA27x sleep fixes:
    * set additional sleep/wakeup registers for Mainstone boards.
    * move CKEN=0 to pxa25x-specific code; that value is harmful on pxa27x.
    * save/restore additional registers, including some found necessary for
    C5 processors and/or newer blob versions.
    * enable future support of additional sleep modes for PXA27x (eg,
    standby, deep sleep).
    * split off cpu-specific sleep processing between pxa27x and pxa25x into
    separate files (partly in preparation for additional sleep modes).

    [PATCH] ARM: 2694/1: [s3c2410/dma] release irq properly to fix kernel oops
    
    Patch from Albrecht Dre
    
    Problem:
    When a module requests a DMA channel via the function s3c2410_dma_request(), this function requests the appropriate irq under the name of the client module. When the client module is unloaded, it calls s3c2410_dma_free() which does not free the irq. Consequently, when e.g. running "cat /proc/interrupts", the irq owner points to freed memory, leading to a kernel oops.

    3. When cpu_idle finds (need_resched() == 'true'), it should call schedule().
    It should not call schedule() otherwise.

    [SCSI] fix slab corruption during ipr probe
    
    With CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y I see slab corruption messages during boot on
    pSeries machines with IPR adapters with any 2.6.12-rc kernel.
    
    The change which seems to have introduced the problem is "SCSI: revamp
    target scanning routines" and may be found at:
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bk-commits-head&m=111093946426333&w=2
    
    In order to revert that in a 2.6.12-rc1 tree, I had to revert "target
    code updates to support scanned targets" first:
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bk-commits-head&m=111094132524649&w=2
    
    With both patches reverted, the corruption messages go away.

    I did some digging and the problem seems to be a refcounting issue in

    Great!  FWIW I've briefly tested a modified version of usbatm using
    the list head in struct urb instead of creating a wrapper struct, and I
    haven't seen any failures yet.  So I tend to believe that your "should
    be" actually means "is" :)

    [PATCH] USB: add Option Card driver
    
    This patch adds a new driver for "Option" cards.  This is a GSM data card,
    controlled by three "serial ports" which are connected via an OHCI adapter,
    all located on an oversized PC-Card.  It's sold by several GSM service
    providers.
    
    Traditionally, this card has been accessed via the standard serial driver
    and appropriate vendor= and product= options.  However, testing has
    revealed several problems with this approach, including hung data transfers
    and lost data blocks when receiving.
    
    Therefore, I've written a separate driver.

    blacklist table.  This patch ensures the lt-20 can be claimed by the
    appropriate driver (cypress_m8).
    
    Adds the product id 0x200, of the DeLorme Earthmate lt-20, to the hid
    blacklist table.

    [PATCH] ext3: fix list scanning in __cleanup_transaction
    
    Fix a bug in list scanning that can cause us to skip the last buffer on the
    checkpoint list (and hence fail to do any progress under some rather
    unfavorable conditions).
    
    The problem is we first do jh=next_jh and then test
    
    	} while (jh!=last_jh);
    
    Hence we skip the last buffer on the list (if it was not the only buffer on
    the list).  As we already do jh=next_jh; in the beginning of the loop we
    are safe to just remove the assignment in the end.  It can happen that 'jh'
    will be freed at the point we test jh != last_jh but that does not matter
    as we never *dereference* the pointer.

    [PATCH] ppc32/ppc64: cleanup /proc/device-tree
    
    This cleans up the /proc/device-tree representation of the Open Firmware
    device-tree on ppc and ppc64.  It does the following things:
    
     - Workaround an issue in some Apple device-trees where a property may
       exist with the same name as a child node of the parent.  We now
       simply "drop" the property instead of creating duplicate entries in
       /proc with random result...
    
     - Do not try to chop off the "@0" at the end of a node name whose unit
       address is 0.  This is not useful, inconsistent, and the code was
       buggy and didn't always work anyway.
    
     - Do not create symlinks for the short name and unit address parts of a
       node.  These were never really used, bloated the memory footprint of
       the device-tree with useless struct proc_dir_entry and their matching
       dentry and inode cache bloat.
    
    This results in smaller code, smaller memory footprint, and a more
    accurate view of the tree presented to userland.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix a device-tree bug on Apple's
    
    Apple's Open Firmware has a funny bug when creating the /cpus nodes
    where it leaves a dangling '\0' character in the CPU name which ends up
    appearing in the full path of the node. This is bogus and
    confuses /proc/device-tree badly.
    
    This patch strips those bogus zero's from the node full path when
    reading the device-tree from Open Firmware. The "name" property is not
    modified and still contains the spurrious 0 (it basically contains 0
    tailing 0 instead of one) but that shouldn't be a problem.
    
    An equivalent patch for ppc32 will follow shortly

    [PATCH] [4/5] ondemand governor automatic downscaling
    
    Here is a change of policy for the ondemand governor. The modification
    concerns the frequency downscaling. Instead of decreasing to a lower
    frequency when the CPU usage is under 20%, this new policy automatically
    scales to the optimal frequency. The optimal frequency being the lowest
    frequency which provides enough power to not trigger the upscaling policy.

    [CPUFREQ] Conservative cpufreq governer
    
    A new cpufreq module, based on the ondemand one with my additional patches
    just posted.  This one is more suitable for battery environments where its
    probably more appealing to have the cpu freq gracefully increase and decrease
    rather than flip between the min and max freq's.
    
    N.B. Bruno Ducrot pointed out that the amd64's "do have unacceptable latency
    between min and max freq transition, due to the step-by-step requirements
    (200MHz IIRC)"; so AMD64 users would probably benefit from this too.

    [SPARC64]: Fix streaming buffer flushing on PCI and SBUS.
    
    Firstly, if the direction is TODEVICE, then dirty data in the
    streaming cache is impossible so we can elide the flush-flag
    synchronization in that case.
    
    Next, the context allocator is broken.  It is highly likely
    that contexts get used multiple times for different dma
    mappings, which confuses the strbuf flushing code and makes
    it run inefficiently.

    flush_icache_range() is used in two different situation - in binfmt_elf.c &
    co for user space mappings and module.c for kernel modules.  On m68k
    flush_icache_range() doesn't know which data to flush, as it has separate
    address spaces and the pointer argument can be valid in either address
    space.
    
    First I considered splitting flush_icache_range(), but this patch is
    simpler.  Setting the correct context gives flush_icache_range() enough
    information to flush the correct data.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: more CPCI updates
    
    Here is my third attempt at a patch to further update the CompactPCI
    hotplug driver infrastructure to address the pci_enable_device issue
    discussed on the list as well as a few other issues I discovered during
    some more testing.  This version addresses a few more issues pointed out
    by Prarit Bhargava.  Changes include:
    - cpci_enable_device and its recursive calling of pci_enable_device on
      new devices removed.
    - Use list_rwsem to avoid slot status change races between disable_slot
      and check_slots.
    - Fixed oopsing in cpci_hp_unregister_bus caused by calling list_del on
      a slot after calling pci_hp_deregister.
    - Removed kfree calls in cleanup_slots since release_slot will have
      done it already.
    - Reworked init_slots a bit to fix latch and adapter file updating on
      subsequent calls to cpci_hp_start.
    - Improved sanity checking in cpci_hp_register_controller.
    - Now shut things down correctly in cpci_hotplug_exit.
    - Switch to pci_get_slot instead of deprecated pci_find_slot.
    - A bunch of CodingStyle fixes.

    This adds support for a CF-card USB Host adapter, the Ratoc REX-CFU1U, by
    wrapping a PCMCIA driver around the existing "sl811-hcd" platform driver.
    
    This CF card is especially useful for PDAs, which currently tend to have

    [PATCH] USB: sl811-hcd fixes
    
    Various fixes to the sl811-hcd driver:
    
      * Fix small glitches that crept in during recent evolution of usbcore's hcd
        glue layer, coupling endpoint state records to usbcore and active urbs.
        (As noted by folk whose boards weren't stuck on 2.6.9 kernels...)
    
      * Cope with various system-specific issues:
          - Some configurations (e.g. a CF-card uses this chip) have iospace
            addresses for the two registers, rather than memory mapped ones.
          - Some configurations do interesting things with IRQs; maybe the
            line is shared, or it doesn't support level triggering.
          - Not all boards can drive the chip reset line in software.
    
      * Address a potential race during unlinking.
    
      * Tweak probe/remove section info to handle the case where this segment
        of a platform bus is hotpluggable (e.g. CF card).  (The basic problem
        is that CONFIG_HOTPLUG is global, which is wrong since not all busses
        can hotplug even on hotplug-friendly systems...)  Also export the
        driver, so that the CF driver can depend on it.
    
    Also removed some annoying end-of-line whitespace.

    [PATCH] I2C: ALI1563 SMBus driver fix
    
    This patch fixes "grave" bugs in i2c-ali1563 driver. It seems on recent
    chipset revisions the HSTS_DONE is set only for block transfers, so we
    must detect the end of ordinary transaction other way. Also due to missing
    and mask, setting other transfer modes was not possible. Moreover the
    continous byte mode transfer uses DAT0 for command rather than CMD command.
    All those changes were tested with help of Chunhao Huang from Winbond.
    
    I'm willing to maintain the driver. Second patch adds me as maintainer
    if this is neccessary.

    [NETFILTER]: Fix deadlock with ip_queue and tcp local input path.
    
    When we have ip_queue being used from LOCAL_IN, then we end up with a
    situation where the verdicts coming back from userspace traverse the TCP
    input path from syscall context.  While this seems to work most of the
    time, there's an ugly deadlock:
    
    syscall context is interrupted by the timer interrupt.  When the timer
    interrupt leaves, the timer softirq get's scheduled and calls
    tcp_delack_timer() and alike.  They themselves do bh_lock_sock(sk),
    which is already held from somewhere else -> boom.
    
    I've now tested the suggested solution by Patrick McHardy and Herbert Xu to
    simply use local_bh_{en,dis}able().

    [BRIDGE]: receive path optimization
    
    This improves the bridge local receive path by avoiding going
    through another softirq.  The bridge receive path is already being called
    from a netif_receive_skb() there is no point in going through another
    receiveq round trip.
    
    Recursion is limited because bridge can never be a port of a bridge
    so handle_bridge() always returns.

    [BRIDGE]: prevent bad forwarding table updates
    
    Avoid poisoning of the bridge forwarding table by frames that have been
    dropped by filtering. This prevents spoofed source addresses on hostile
    side of bridge from causing packet leakage, a small but possible security
    risk.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Simplified load string emulation error checking
    
    The error checking for emulation of load string instructions was overly
    generous and would cause certain valid forms of the instructions to be
    treated as illegal.  We drop the range checking since the architecture
    allows this to be boundedly undefined.  Tests on CPUs that support these
    instructions appear not do cause illegal instruction traps on range errors
    and just allow the execution to occur.
    
    Thanks to Kim Phillips for debugging this and figuring out what real HW was
    doing.

    [PATCH] uml: remove jail mode + other leftovers
    
    This var is currently useless, as it's apparent from reading the code. Until

            if(jail){
    		while(!reading) sched_yield();
    	}
    
    jail mode has been dropped, together with that use, so let's finish dropping
    this.
    
    Also, remove some other useless definitions I met.

    Port Paulus's ppc64 fix to sh:
    
      When the generic IRQ stuff went in, it seems that HARDIRQ_BITS got bumped

      within HARDIRQ_MASK, and I get in_interrupt() falsely returning true when
      PREEMPT_ACTIVE is set, and thus a BUG_ON tripping in arch/ppc64/mm/tlb.c.

    [PATCH] intelfb section fix
    
    On Nov 16 2004 a change to intelfbdrv.c was commited (as part of 0.9.2 it
    looks like) that added __initdata to all of the module param variables that
    seems to create the opportunity for an oops.
    
    I've recently been chasing an OOPS
    (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111552250920370&w=2) I
    created by reading every file on the /sys file system and I've traced it
    back to this code in the intelfbdrv.  Though I had root privs in my initial
    problem report, it turns out they are un-necessary to generate the oops -
    all you've got to do is "cat /sys/module/intelfb/parameters/mode" enough
    times and eventually it will oops.
    
    This is because sysfs automatically exports all module_param declarations
    to the sysfs file system..  which means those variables can be dynamically
    evaluated at any later time, which of course means marking them __initdata
    is a bad idea ;)..  when they happen to be char *'s it is an especially bad
    idea ;).
    
    Applying the patch below clears up the OOPS for me.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix cpufreq vs. sleep issue
    
    Recent kernels occasionally trigger a PMU timeout on some mac laptops,
    typically on wakeup from sleep.  This seem to be caused by either a too big
    latency caused by the cpufreq switch on wakeup from sleep or by an
    interrupt beeing lost due to the reset of the interrupt controller done
    during wakeup.
    
    This patch makes that code more robust by stopping PMU auto poll activity
    around cpufreq changes on machines that use the PMU for such changes (long
    latency switching involving a CPU hard reset and flush of all caches) and
    by removing the reset of the open pic interrupt controller on wakeup (that
    can cause the loss of an interrupt and Darwin doesn't do it, so it must not
    be necessary).

    [PATCH] drop note_interrupt() for per-CPU for proper scaling
    
    The "unhandled interrupts" catcher, note_interrupt(), increments a global
    desc->irq_count and grossly damages scaling of very large systems, e.g.,
    >192p ia64 Altix, because of this highly contented cacheline, especially
    for timer interrupts.  384p is severely crippled, and 512p is unuseable.
    
    All calls to note_interrupt() can be disabled by booting with "noirqdebug",
    but this disables the useful interrupt checking for all interrupts.
    
    I propose eliminating note_interrupt() for all per-CPU interrupts.  This
    was the behavior of linux-2.6.10 and earlier, but in 2.6.11 a code
    restructuring added a call to note_interrupt() for per-CPU interrupts.
    Besides, note_interrupt() is a bit racy for concurrent CPU calls anyway, as
    the desc->irq_count++ increment isn't atomic (which, if done, would make
    scaling even worse).

    This patch also removes the non-working and now obsolete SOUND_GAMEPORT.
    
    This patch is also an alternative solution for ALSA drivers with similar
    problems (but #if's inside the drivers might have the advantage of
    saving some more bytes of gameport is not available).
    
    The only user-visible change is that for GAMEPORT=m the affected OSS
    drivers are now allowed to be built statically (but they won't have
    gameport support).

    [PATCH] drivers/scsi/sata_vsc: add #include req'd for DMA_32BIT_MASK constant
    
    The previous patch did not compile cleanly on all architectures so
    here's a fixed one which #includes <linux/dma-mapping.h>.
    
    Use the DMA_{64,32}BIT_MASK constants from dma-mapping.h when calling
    pci_set_dma_mask() or pci_set_consistent_dma_mask()
    This patch includes dma-mapping.h explicitly because it caused errors
    on some architectures otherwise.

    [PATCH] Note on ACPI build fix
    
    Even after the previous fix you can still set CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT
    indirectly even without CONFIG_ACPI by choosing CONFIG_PCI and
    CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG.
    
    That doesn't build very well either.
    
    This makes PCI_MMCONFIG depend on ACPI, fixing that hole.
    
    [ I guess in theory Kconfig could follow the whole chain of dependencies
      for things that get selected, but that sounds insanely complicated, so
      we'll just fix up these things by hand.  --Linus ]

    [PATCH] cpuset exit NULL dereference fix
    
    There is a race in the kernel cpuset code, between the code
    to handle notify_on_release, and the code to remove a cpuset.
    The notify_on_release code can end up trying to access a
    cpuset that has been removed.  In the most common case, this
    causes a NULL pointer dereference from the routine cpuset_path.
    However all manner of bad things are possible, in theory at least.
    
    The existing code decrements the cpuset use count, and if the
    count goes to zero, processes the notify_on_release request,
    if appropriate.  However, once the count goes to zero, unless we
    are holding the global cpuset_sem semaphore, there is nothing to
    stop another task from immediately removing the cpuset entirely,
    and recycling its memory.
    
    The obvious fix would be to always hold the cpuset_sem
    semaphore while decrementing the use count and dealing with
    notify_on_release.  However we don't want to force a global
    semaphore into the mainline task exit path, as that might create
    a scaling problem.
    
    The actual fix is almost as easy - since this is only an issue
    for cpusets using notify_on_release, which the top level big
    cpusets don't normally need to use, only take the cpuset_sem
    for cpusets using notify_on_release.
    
    This code has been run for hours without a hiccup, while running
    a cpuset create/destroy stress test that could crash the existing
    kernel in seconds.  This patch applies to the current -linus
    git kernel.

    [PATCH] remove non-cleanroom pwc driver compression
    
    The original pwc author raised some questions about the reverse
    engineering of the decompressor algorithms used in the pwc driver.
    Having done some detailed investigation it appears those concerns that
    clean room policy was not followed are reasonable.  I've also had a
    friendly discussion with Philips to ask their view on this.
    
    This removes the problem items of code which reduces the pwc
    functionality in the kernel a little but leaves all the framework for
    setup that will be needed for decompressors in user space (where they
    eventually belong).  This change set is designed to be the minimal risk
    change set given that 2.6.12 is hopefully close to hand, with a view to
    merging the much updated pwc code in 2.6.13 series kernels.
    
    Someone else can then redo the decompressors properly (clean room) in
    user space.
    
    Note that while its easy to say that it should have been caught earlier,
    but the violation was really only obvious to someone who had access to
    both the proprietary source and the 'GPL' source.

    libata: Fix use-after-iounmap
    
    Jens Axboe pointed out that the iounmap() call in libata was occurring
    too early, and some drivers (ahci, probably others) were using ioremap'd
    memory after it had been unmapped.
    
    The patch should address that problem by way of improving the libata
    driver API:
    
    * move ->host_stop() call after all ->port_stop() calls have occurred.
    
    * create default helper function ata_host_stop(), and move iounmap()
    call there.
    
    * add ->host_stop_prewalk() hook, use it in sata_qstor.c (hi Mark).
    sata_qstor appears to require the host-stop-before-port-stop ordering
    that existed prior to applying the attached patch.

    [PATCH] i386: fix prevent_tail_call
    
    We fixed this bug before, but it didn't take.  It may have been the case
    that the problem was first noticed to occur in a CONFIG_REGPARM compile.
    But it's not regparm functions that need not to make tail calls, it's
    asmlinkage functions called with a user pt_regs frame on the stack
    supplying their arguments.  prevent_tail_call probably doesn't do anything
    at all in regparm functions (your argument registers are going to be
    clobbered, period).  It was a braino to conditionalize that definition in
    the first place.

    [PKT_SCHED] netem: use only inner qdisc -- no private skbuff queue
    
    Netem works better if there if packets are just queued in the inner discipline
    rather than having a separate delayed queue. Change to use the dequeue/requeue
    to peek like TBF does.
    
    By doing this potential qlen problems with the old method are avoided. The problems
    happened when the netem_run that moved packets from the inner discipline to the nested
    discipline failed (because inner queue was full). This happened in dequeue, so the
    effective qlen of the netem would be decreased (because of the drop), but there was
    no way to keep the outer qdisc (caller of netem dequeue) in sync.
    
    The problem window is still there since this patch doesn't address the issue of
    requeue failing in netem_dequeue, but that shouldn't happen since the sequence dequeue/requeue
    should always work.  Long term correct fix is to implement qdisc->peek in all the qdisc's
    to allow for this (needed by several other qdisc's as well).

    [PATCH] timeout at boottime with NEC3500A (and possibly others) when inserted a CD in it
    
    From: Marcello Maggioni <hayarms@gmail.com>
    
    Problem: Some drives (NEC 3500, TDK 1616N, Mad-dog MD-16XDVD9, RICOH
    MP5163DA, Memorex DVD9 drive and IO-DATA's too for sure), if a
    CD/DVD is inserted into the tray when the system is booted and if
    before the OS bootup the BIOS checked for the presence of a bootable
    CD/DVD into the drive, during the IDE probe phase the drive may
    result busy and remain so for the next 25/30 seconds . This cause the
    drive to be skipped during the booting phase and not begin usable
    until the next reboot (if the reboot goes well and the drive doesn't
    timeout again).
    
    Solution: Rising the timeout time from 10 seconds to 35 seconds
    (during these 35 seconds every drive should wake up for sure
    according to the tests I've done).

    #define sg_dma_address(sg)	((sg)->dma_address)
    #define sg_dma_len(sg)		((sg)->dma_length)
    
    So, if the scatterlist is not DMA mapped, sg_dma_len() will return zero on ppc64.
    The same problem should occur on the x86-64 platform.
    On the i386 platform, sg_dma_len() returns sg->length, that's why the problem does not occur on an i386.
    
    Changes:
    - Use sg->length if the scatterlist is not DMA mapped (yet).

    [PATCH] IB: allow NULL sa_query callbacks
    
    Check if a client passes a NULL callback into an SA query, and if so, never
    call back.  This fixes an oops if someone unloads ib_ipoib and ib_sa in
    rapid succession.  ib_ipoib does an MCMember delete with a NULL callback
    and 0 timeout on unload, which is usually fine since the delete completes
    successfully.  However, if ib_sa is unloaded immediately afterwards, the
    delete will be canceled and ib_sa will try to call the (now already
    unloaded) ib_ipoib module back with the cancel completion, which triggers
    the oops.

    [PATCH] ppc64 iSeries: fix boot time setting
    
    For quite a while, there has existed a hypervisor bug on legacy iSeries
    which means that we do not get the boot time set in the kernel.  This
    patch works around that bug.  This was most noticable when the root
    partition needed to be checked at every boot as the kernel thought it
    was some time in 1905 until user mode reset the time correctly.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix initialisation of gettimeofday calculations
    
    On PPC64, we keep track of when we need to update jiffies (and the
    variables used to calculate the time of day) based on the time base.
    
    If the time base frequence is sufficiently high compared to the
    processor clock frequency, then it is possible for the time of day
    variables to be corrupted at the time of the first decrementer interrupt
    we take.  This became obvious on a legacy iSeries where the time base
    frequency is the same as the processor clock.
    
    This one line patch fixes the initialisation so that the time of day
    variables and the indicator we use to tell when updates are due are
    better synchronised.

    [PATCH] try_to_unmap_cluster() passes out-of-bounds pte to pte_unmap()
    
    try_to_unmap_cluster() does:
            for (pte = pte_offset_map(pmd, address);
                            address < end; pte++, address += PAGE_SIZE) {
    		...
    	}
    
    	pte_unmap(pte);
    
    It may take a little staring to notice, but pte can actually fall off the
    end of the pte page in this iteration, which makes life difficult for
    kmap_atomic() and the users not expecting it to BUG().  Of course, we're
    somewhat lucky in that arithmetic elsewhere in the function guarantees that
    at least one iteration is made, lest this force larger rearrangements to be
    made.  This issue and patch also apply to non-mm mainline and with trivial
    adjustments, at least two related kernels.

    [PATCH] tulip: add return to ULI526X clause in tulip_mdio_write
    
    The 'if' clause for ULI526X in tulip_mdio_write allows for
    spin_unlock_irqrestore to be called twice for tp->mii_lock.  I believe
    this is caused by the unintentional omission of a return at the end
    of that clause.  This patch adds that return.

    [PATCH] driver core: restore event order for device_add()
    
    As a result of the split of the kobject-registration and the

    [SPARC64]: Add boot option to force UltraSPARC-III P-Cache on.
    
    Older UltraSPARC-III chips have a P-Cache bug that makes us disable it
    by default at boot time.
    
    However, this does hurt performance substantially, particularly with
    memcpy(), and the bug is _incredibly_ obscure.  I have never seen it
    triggered in practice, ever.
    
    So provide a "-P" boot option that forces the P-Cache on.  It taints
    the kernel, so if it does trigger and cause some data corruption or
    OOPS, we will find out in the logs that this option was on when it
    happened.

    [TCP]: Fix stretch ACK performance killer when doing ucopy.
    
    When we are doing ucopy, we try to defer the ACK generation to
    cleanup_rbuf().  This works most of the time very well, but if the
    ucopy prequeue is large, this ACKing behavior kills performance.
    
    With TSO, it is possible to fill the prequeue so large that by the
    time the ACK is sent and gets back to the sender, most of the window
    has emptied of data and performance suffers significantly.
    
    This behavior does help in some cases, so we should think about
    re-enabling this trick in the future, using some kind of limit in
    order to avoid the bug case.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix g5 hw timebase sync
    
    The hardware sync of the timebase on SMP G5s uses a black magic

    However, this was an earlier version of Darwin that was ...  buggy !
    heh.  This causes the latest models to break though when starting SMP,
    so it's worth fixing.
    
    Here's a new version of the incantation based on careful transcription
    of the said incantations as found in the latest version of apple's
    temple.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix booting on latest G5 models
    
    The latest speedbumped Apple G5 models have a "bug" in the Open Firmware
    device tree that lacks the proper interrupt routing information for the
    northbridge i2c controller.  Apple's driver silently falls back into a
    sub-optimal "polled" mode (heh, maybe they didn't even notice the bug
    because of that :), our driver didn't properly check and crashes :(
    
    This patch fixes our driver to not crash, and adds code to the
    prom_init() OF trampoline code that detects the "bug" and adds the
    missing information back for this chipset revision.  This fixes booting
    and thermal control on these models.

    [PATCH] fix for __generic_file_aio_read() to return 0 on EOF
    
    I came across the following problem while running ltp-aiodio testcases from
    ltp-full-20050405 on linux-2.6.12-rc3-mm3.  I tried running the tests with
    EXT3 as well as JFS filesystems.
    
    One or two fsx-linux testcases were hung after some time.  These testcases
    were hanging at wait_for_all_aios().
    
    Debugging shows that there were some iocbs which were not getting completed
    eventhough the last retry for those returned -EIOCBQUEUED.  Also all such
    pending iocbs represented READ operation.
    
    Further debugging revealed that all such iocbs hit EOF in the DIO layer.
    To be more precise, the "pos" from which they were trying to read was
    greater than the "size" of the file.  So the generic_file_direct_IO
    returned 0.
    
    This happens rarely as there is already a check in
    __generic_file_aio_read(), for whether "pos" < "size" before calling direct
    IO routine.
    
    >size = i_size_read(inode);
    >if (pos < size) {
    >	  retval = generic_file_direct_IO(READ, iocb,
    >                               iov, pos, nr_segs);
    
    But for READ, we are taking the inode->i_sem only in the DIO layer.  So it
    is possible that some other process can change the size of the file before
    we take the i_sem.  In such a case ( when "pos" > "size"), the
    __generic_file_aio_read() would return -EIOCBQUEUED even though there were
    no I/O requests submitted by the DIO layer.  This would cause the AIO layer
    to expect aio_complete() for THE iocb, which doesnot happen.  And thus the
    test hangs forever, waiting for an I/O completion, where there are no
    requests submitted at all.
    
    The following patch makes __generic_file_aio_read() return 0 (instead of
    returning -EIOCBQUEUED), on getting 0 from generic_file_direct_IO(), so
    that the AIO layer does the aio_complete().
    
    Testing:
    
    I have tested the patch on a SMP machine(with 2 Pentium 4 (HT)) running
    linux-2.6.12-rc3-mm3.  I ran the ltp-aiodio testcases and none of the
    fsx-linux tests hung.  Also the aio-stress tests ran without any problem.

    [PATCH] spin_unlock_bh() and preempt_check_resched()
    
    In _spin_unlock_bh(lock):
    	do { \
    		_raw_spin_unlock(lock); \
    		preempt_enable(); \
    		local_bh_enable(); \
    		__release(lock); \
    	} while (0)
    
    there is no reason for using preempt_enable() instead of a simple
    preempt_enable_no_resched()
    
    Since we know bottom halves are disabled, preempt_schedule() will always
    return at once (preempt_count!=0), and hence preempt_check_resched() is
    useless here...
    
    This fixes it by using "preempt_enable_no_resched()" instead of the
    "preempt_enable()", and thus avoids the useless preempt_check_resched()
    just before re-enabling bottom halves.

    The test case at

    ce/interfaces/clock_nanosleep/1-5.c fails if it runs as a 32bit process on

    The root cause is the sub 32bit process fails to restart the syscall after it
    is interrupted by a signal.
    
    The syscall number of sys_restart_syscall in table sys_call_table is
    __NR_restart_syscall (219) while it's __NR_ia32_restart_syscall
    (0) in ia32_sys_call_table. When regs->rax==(unsigned
    long)-ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK, function do_signal doesn't distinguish if
    the process is 64bit or 32bit, and always sets restart syscall number
    as __NR_restart_syscall (219).

    [PATCH] cpusets+hotplug+preepmt broken
    
    This patch removes the entwining of cpusets and hotplug code in the "No
    more Mr.  Nice Guy" case of sched.c move_task_off_dead_cpu().
    
    Since the hotplug code is holding a spinlock at this point, we cannot take
    the cpuset semaphore, cpuset_sem, as would seem to be required either to
    update the tasks cpuset, or to scan up the nested cpuset chain, looking for
    the nearest cpuset ancestor that still has some CPUs that are online.  So
    we just punt and blast the tasks cpus_allowed with all bits allowed.
    
    This reverts these lines of code to what they were before the cpuset patch.
     And it updates the cpuset Doc file, to match.
    
    The one known alternative to this that seems to work came from Dinakar
    Guniguntala, and required the hotplug code to take the cpuset_sem semaphore
    much earlier in its processing.  So far as we know, the increased locking
    entanglement between cpusets and hot plug of this alternative approach is
    not worth doing in this case.

    [SCSI] aic7xxx: make correct use of slave_alloc/destroy and remove the per device timer
    
    The allocation of all of our components should be done in slave alloc.
    Currently it's rather fancifully refcounted in the queuecommand
    callback.  This patch moves allocation and destroy to their correct
    places in slave_alloc/slave_destory.  Now we can guarantee that
    everywhere a device is requested, it's actually been allocated, so don't
    check for this anymore.
    
    Additionally, the per device busy timer was the only source of potential
    use after free.  It's been deleted because Linux does the correct thing
    with busy returns, so there's no need to implement a separate timer in
    the driver.
    
    Finally, implement code that forces all the device parameters to zero
    (i.e. async and narrow) in the slave alloc, inform the spi class of the
    bios recorded maximums and wait until slave configure before trying
    anything more adventurous.

    [PATCH] ppc32: don't call progress functions after boot
    
    On ppc32, the platform code can supply a "progress" function that is
    used to show progress through the boot.  These functions are usually
    in an init section and so can't be called after the init pages are
    freed.  Now that the cpu bringup code can be called after the system
    is booted (for hotplug cpu) we can get the situation where the
    progress function can be called after boot.  The simple fix is to set
    the progress function pointer to NULL when the init pages are freed,
    and that is what this patch does (note that all callers already check
    whether the function pointer is NULL before trying to call it).

    Fix get_unmapped_area sanity tests
    
    As noted by Chris Wright, we need to do the full range of tests regardless
    of whether MAP_FIXED is set or not, so re-organize get_unmapped_area()
    slightly to do the sanity checks unconditionally.

    [NETLINK]: Defer socket destruction a bit
    
    In netlink_broadcast() we're sending shared skb's to netlink listeners
    when possible (saves some copying). This is OK, since we hold the only
    other reference to the skb.
    
    However, this implies that we must drop our reference on the skb, before
    allowing a receiving socket to disappear. Otherwise, the socket buffer
    accounting is disrupted.

    [NETLINK]: Fix race with recvmsg().
    
    This bug causes:
    
    assertion (!atomic_read(&sk->sk_rmem_alloc)) failed at net/netlink/af_netlink.c (122)
    
    What's happening is that:
    
    1) The skb is sent to socket 1.
    2) Someone does a recvmsg on socket 1 and drops the ref on the skb.
       Note that the rmalloc is not returned at this point since the
       skb is still referenced.
    3) The same skb is now sent to socket 2.
    
    This version of the fix resurrects the skb_orphan call that was moved
    out, last time we had 'shared-skb troubles'. It is practically a no-op
    in the common case, but still prevents the possible race with recvmsg.

    [IPV4/IPV6] Ensure all frag_list members have NULL sk
    
    Having frag_list members which holds wmem of an sk leads to nightmares
    with partially cloned frag skb's.  The reason is that once you unleash
    a skb with a frag_list that has individual sk ownerships into the stack
    you can never undo those ownerships safely as they may have been cloned
    by things like netfilter.  Since we have to undo them in order to make
    skb_linearize happy this approach leads to a dead-end.
    
    So let's go the other way and make this an invariant:
    
    	For any skb on a frag_list, skb->sk must be NULL.
    
    That is, the socket ownership always belongs to the head skb.
    It turns out that the implementation is actually pretty simple.
    
    The above invariant is actually violated in the following patch
    for a short duration inside ip_fragment.  This is OK because the
    offending frag_list member is either destroyed at the end of the
    slow path without being sent anywhere, or it is detached from
    the frag_list before being sent.

    [XFRM]: skb_cow_data() does not set proper owner for new skbs.
    
    It looks like skb_cow_data() does not set
    proper owner for newly created skb.
    
    If we have several fragments for skb and some of them
    are shared(?) or cloned (like in async IPsec) there
    might be a situation when we require recreating skb and
    thus using skb_copy() for it.
    Newly created skb has neither a destructor nor a socket
    assotiated with it, which must be copied from the old skb.
    As far as I can see, current code sets destructor and socket
    for the first one skb only and uses truesize of the first skb
    only to increment sk_wmem_alloc value.
    
    If above "analysis" is correct then attached patch fixes that.

    [TG3]: Set minimal hw interrupt mitigation.
    
    Even though we do software interrupt mitigation
    via NAPI, it still helps to have some minimal
    hw assisted mitigation.
    
    This helps, particularly, on systems where register
    I/O overhead is much greater than the CPU horsepower.
    
    For example, it helps on NUMA systems.  In such cases
    the PIO overhead to disable interrupts for NAPI accounts
    for the majority of the packet processing cost.  The
    CPU is fast enough such that only a single packet is
    processed by each NAPI poll call.

    [TG3]: Add tagged status support.
    
    When supported, use the TAGGED interrupt processing support
    the chip provides.  In this mode, instead of a "on/off" binary
    semaphore, an incrementing tag scheme is used to ACK interrupts.
    
    All MSI supporting chips support TAGGED mode, so the tg3_msi()
    interrupt handler uses it unconditionally.  This invariant is
    verified when MSI support is tested.
    
    Since we can invoke tg3_poll() multiple times per interrupt under
    high packet load, we fetch a new copy of the tag value in the
    status block right before we actually do the work.
    
    Also, because the tagged status tells the chip exactly which
    work we have processed, we can make two optimizations:
    
    1) tg3_restart_ints() need not check tg3_has_work()
    2) the tg3_timer() need not poke the chip 10 times per
       second to keep from losing interrupt events

    can also be used in case of serious unexpected bugs in perfmon. Mutual
    exclusion between the two subsystems is guaranteed, hence no conflict
    can arise from both subsystem being present.

    [PATCH] Avoid console spam with ext3 aborted journal.
    
    Avoid console spam with ext3 aborted journal.
    
    ext3 usually reports error conditions that it detects in its environment.
    But when its journal gets aborted due to such errors, it can sometimes
    continue to report that condition forever, spamming the console to such
    an extent that the initial first cause of the journal abort can be lost.
    
    When the journal aborts, we put the filesystem into readonly mode.  Most
    subsequent filesystem operations will get rejected immediately by checks
    for MS_RDONLY either in the filesystem or in the VFS.  But some paths do
    not have such checks --- for example, if we continue to write to a file
    handle that was opened before the fs went readonly.  (We only check for
    the ROFS condition when the file is first opened.)  In these cases, we
    can continue to generate log errors similar to
    
    EXT3-fs error (device $DEV) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
    
    for each subsequent write.
    
    There is really no point in generating these errors after the initial
    error has been fully reported.  Specifically, if we're starting a
    completely new filesystem operation, and the filesystem is *already*
    readonly (ie. the ext3 layer has already detected and handled the
    underlying jbd abort), and we see an EROFS error, then there is simply
    no point in reporting it again.

    [PATCH] Fix filp being passed through raw ioctl handler
    
    Don't pass meaningless file handles to block device ioctls.
    
    The recent raw IO ioctl-passthrough fix started passing the raw file
    handle into the block device ioctl handler.  That's unlikely to be
    useful, as the file handle is actually open on a character-mode raw
    device, not a block device, so dereferencing it is not going to yield
    useful results to a block device ioctl handler.
    
    Previously we just passed NULL; also not a value that can usefully
    be dereferenced, but at least if it does happen, we'll oops instead of
    silently pretending that the file is a block device, so NULL is the more
    defensive option here.  This patch reverts to that behaviour.

    [PATCH] Driver Core: remove driver model detach_state
    
    The driver model has a "detach_state" mechanism that:
    
     - Has never been used by any in-kernel drive;
     - Is superfluous, since driver remove() methods can do the same thing;
     - Became buggy when the suspend() parameter changed semantics and type;
     - Could self-deadlock when called from certain suspend contexts;
     - Is effectively wasted documentation, object code, and headspace.
    
    This removes that "detach_state" mechanism; net code shrink, as well
    as a per-device saving in the driver model and sysfs.

    [PATCH] Driver Core: pm diagnostics update, check for errors
    
    This patch includes various tweaks in the messaging that appears during
    system pm state transitions:
    
      * Warn about certain illegal calls in the device tree, like resuming
        child before parent or suspending parent before child.  This could
        happen easily enough through sysfs, or in some cases when drivers
        use device_pm_set_parent().
    
      * Be more consistent about dev_dbg() tracing ... do it for resume() and
        shutdown() too, and never if the driver doesn't have that method.
    
      * Say which type of system sleep state is being entered.
    
    Except for the warnings, these only affect debug messaging.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: remove pci_visit_dev
    
    If my CPCI hotplug update patch is applied, then there are no longer any
    in tree users of the pci_visit_dev API, and it and its related code can be
    removed.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: CPCI update
    
    [PATCH] CPCI: update
    
    I have finally done some work to update the CompactPCI hotplug driver to
    fix some of the outstanding issues in 2.6:
    - Added adapter and latch status ops so that those files will get created
      by the current PCI hotplug core.  This used to not be required, but
      seems to be now after some of the sysfs rework in the core.
    - Replaced slot list spinlock with a r/w semaphore to avoid any potential
      issues with sleeping.  This quiets all of the runtime warnings.
    - Reworked interrupt driven hot extraction handling to remove need for a
      polling operator for ENUM# status.  There are a lot of boards that only
      have an interrupt driven by ENUM#, so this lowers the bar to entry.
    - Replaced pci_visit_dev usage with better use of the PCI core functions.
      The new code is functionally equivalent to the previous code, but the
      use of pci_enable_device on insert needs to be investigated further, as
      I need to do some more testing to see if it is still necessary.

    [PATCH] PCI Hotplug: Fix echoing 1 to power file of enabled slot problem with SHPC driver
    
    Here is a patch to fix the problem of echoing 1 to "power" file
    to enabled slot causing the slot to power down, and echoing 0
    to disabled slot causing shpchp_disabled_slot() to be called
    twice. This problem was reported by kenji Kaneshige.

    [IA64-SGI] cpe interrupts are not being enabled.
    
    acpi_request_vector() is called in ia64_mca_init() to get the cpe_vector.
    The problem is that acpi_request_vector() looks in platform_intr_list[] to
    get the vector, but platform_intr_list[] is not initialized with a valid
    vector until later (in sn_setup()).  Without a valid vector the code
    defaults to polling mode.
    
    This patch moves the call to acpi_request_vector() from ia64_mca_init()
    to ia64_mca_late_init(), which is after platform_intr_list[] is initialized.

    [PATCH] dvb: flexcop: fix USB transfer handling
    
    - driver receives many null TS packets (pid=0x1fff).  They occupy the
      limited USB bandwidth and this leads to loss of video packets.  Enabling the
      null packet filter fixes this.
    
    - packets that flexcop sends to USB have a 2 byte header that has to be
      removed.
    
    - sometimes a TS packet is split between different urbs.  These parts have
      to be combined in a temporary buffer.

    [PATCH] profile.c: `schedule' parsing fix
    
    profile=schedule parsing is not quite what it should be.  First, str[7] is
    'e', not ',', but then even if it did fall through, prof_on =
    SCHED_PROFILING would be clobbered inside if (get_option(...)) So a small
    amount of rearrangement is done in this patch to correct it.

    [PATCH] selinux: fix avc_alloc_node() oom with no policy loaded
    
    This patch should fix the avc_alloc_node() oom condition that Andrew
    reported when no policy is loaded in SELinux.
    
    Prior to this patch, when no policy was loaded, the SELinux "security
    server" (policy engine) was only returning allowed decisions for the
    requested permissions for each access check.  This caused the cache to
    thrash when trying to use SELinux for real work with no policy loaded
    (typically, the no policy loaded state is only for bootstrapping to the
    point where we can load an initial policy).
    
    This patch changes the SELinux security server to return the complete
    allowed access vector at once, and then to reset the cache after the
    initial policy load to flush the initial cache state created during
    bootstrapping.

    [PATCH] block_read_full_page() get_block() error handling fix
    
    If block_read_full_page() detects an error when running get_block() it will
    run SetPageError(), then it will zero out the block in pagecache and will mark
    the buffer_head uptodate.
    
    So at the end of readahead we end up with a non-uptodate pagecache page which
    is marked PageError.  But it has uptodate buffers.
    
    The pagefault code will run ClearPageError, will launch readpage a second time
    and block_read_full_page() will notice the uptodate buffers and will mark the
    page uptodate as well.  We end up with an uptodate, !PageError page full of
    zeros and the error is lost.
    
    (It seems a little odd that filemap_nopage() runs ClearPageError().  I guess
    all of this adds up to meaning that for each attempted access to the page, the
    pagefault handler will retry the I/O.  Which is good and bad.  If the app is
    ignoring SIGBUS for some reason we could get a lot of back-to-back I/O
    errors.)
    
    Fix it by not marking the pagecache buffer_head as uptodate if the attempt to
    map that buffer to a disk block failed.

    [PATCH] spurious interrupt fix
    
    On my IA64 machine, after kernel 2.6.12-rc3 boots, an edge-triggered
    interrupt (IRQ 46) keeps triggered over and over again.  There is no IRQ 46
    interrupt action handler.  It has lots of impact on performance.
    
    Kernel 2.6.10 and its prior versions have no the problem.  Basically,
    kernel 2.6.10 will mask the spurious edge interrupt if the interrupt is
    triggered for the second time and its status includes
    IRQ_DISABLE|IRQ_PENDING.
    
    Originally, IA64 kernel has its own specific _irq_desc definitions in file
    arch/ia64/kernel/irq.c.  The definition initiates _irq_desc[irq].status to
    IRQ_DISABLE.  Since kernel 2.6.11, it was moved to architecture independent
    codes, i.e.  kernel/irq/handle.c, but kernel/irq/handle.c initiates
    _irq_desc[irq].status to 0 instead of IRQ_DISABLE.

    [PATCH] CDRW/DVD packet writing data corruption fix
    
    I found a bug in the packet writing driver that could cause data
    corruption.  The problem arised if the driver got a write request for a
    sector in a "zone" it was already working on.  In that case it was supposed
    to queue the write request until it was done processing earlier requests
    for the same zone, and instead work on some other zone in the mean time.
    However, if there was no other zone to work on, the driver would initiate
    two packet_data objects for the same zone, causing unpredictable things to
    happen.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Don't assume BSP has ID 0 in new smp bootup
    
    This patch removes the assumption that LAPIC entries contain the BSP as its
    first entry.  This is a slight improvement to the temporary fix submitted by
    Suresh Siddha.
    
    - Removes assumption that LAPIC entries contain BSP first.
    
    - Builds x86_acpiid_to_apicid[] and bios_cpu_apicid[] properly with BSP as
      first entry.
    
    - Made maxcpus=1 boot on these systems.  Since the parsing earlier in
      arch/x86_64/kernel/mpparse.c stopped after maxcpus entries, other entries
      were not processed, this causes kernel not to boot on these systems.
    
    TBD: x86_acpiid_to_apicid and bios_cpu_apicid[] seem to be exactly the
         same.  This could be removed, but might need more work to cleanup.

    - Remove earlier move of check_nmi_watchdog to later.  It does not fix the
      race it was supposed to fix fully.
    
    - Remove unused P6 definitions
    
    - Add support for performance counter based watchdog on P4 systems.
    
      This allows to run it only once per second, which saves some CPU time.
      Previously it would run at 1000Hz, which was too much.
    
      Code ported from i386
    
      Make this the default on Intel systems.
    
    - Use check_nmi_watchdog with local APIC based nmi
    
    - Fix race in touch_nmi_watchdog
    
    - Fix bug that caused incorrect performance counters to be programmed in a
      few cases on K8.
    
    - Remove useless check for local APIC
    
    - Use local_t and per_cpu variables for per CPU data.
    
    - Keep other CPUs busy during check_nmi_watchdog to make sure they really
      tick when in lapic mode.
    
    - Only check CPUs that are actually online.
    
    - Various other fixes.
    
    - Fix fallback path when MSRs are unimplemented

    [PATCH] x86_64: Add pmtimer support
    
    There are unfortunately more and more multi processor Opteron systems which
    don't have HPET timer support in the southbridge.  This covers in particular
    Nvidia and VIA chipsets.  They also don't guarantee that the TSCs are
    synchronized between CPUs; and especially with MP powernow the systems are
    nearly unusable because the time gets very inconsistent between CPUs.
    
    The timer code for x86-64 was originally written under the assumption that we
    could fall back to the HPET timer on such systems.  But this doesn't work
    there.
    
    Another alternative is to use the ACPI PM timer as primary time source.  This
    patch does that.  The kernel only uses PM timer when there is no other choice
    because it has some disadvantages.
    
    Ported over from i386.  It should be faster than the i386 version because I
    dropped the "read three times" workaround, but is still considerable slower
    than HPET and also does not work together with vsyscalls which have to be
    disabled.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Update TSC sync algorithm
    
    The new TSC sync algorithm recently submitted did not work too well.
    
    The result was that some MP machines where the TSC came up of the BIOS very
    unsynchronized and that did not have HPET support were nearly unusable because
    the time would jump forwards and backwards between CPUs.
    
    After a lot of research ;-) and some more prototypes I ended up with just
    using the one from IA64 which looks best.  It has some internal self tuning
    that should adapt to changing interconnect latencies.  It holds up in my tests
    so far.
    
    I believe it was originally written by David Mosberger, I just ported it over
    to x86-64.  See the inline comment for a description.
    
    This cleans up the code because it uses smp_call_function for syncing instead
    of having custom hooks in SMP bootup.
    
    Please note that the cycle numbers it outputs are too optimistic because they
    do not take into account the latency of WRMSR and RDTSC, which can be hundreds
    of cycles.  It seems to be able to sync a dual Opteron to 200-300 cycles,
    which is probably good enough.
    
    There is a timing window during AP bootup where interrupts can see
    inconsistent time before the TSC is synced.  It is hard to avoid unfortunately
    because we can only do the TSC sync after some setup, and we need to enable
    interrupts before that.  I just ignored it for now.

    Last round hopefully of cpu_core_id changes hopefully fow now:
    
    - Always initialize cpu_core_id for all CPUs, even when no dual core setup
      is detected.  This prevents funny /proc/cpuinfo output
    
    - Do the same with phys_proc_id[] even when no HyperThreading - dito.
    
    - Use the CPU APIC-ID from CPUID 1 instead of the linux virtual CPU number
      to identify the core for AMD dual core setups.

     - Two tweaks to the pseudo-MDLM support:

        * ignore a padding bit that doesn't seem necessary
    
     - Remove ID for one Motorola phone that uses the MDLM stuff.

    [PATCH] Fix root hole in pktcdvd
    
    ioctl_by_bdev may only be used INSIDE the kernel.  If the "arg" argument
    refers to memory that is accessed by put_user/get_user in the ioctl
    function, the memory needs to be in the kernel address space (that's the
    set_fs(KERNEL_DS) doing in the ioctl_by_bdev).  This works on i386 because
    even with set_fs(KERNEL_DS) the user space memory is still accessible with
    put_user/get_user.  That is not true for s390.  In short the ioctl
    implementation of the pktcdvd device driver is horribly broken.

    [PATCH] Fix root hole in raw device
    
    [Patch] Fix raw device ioctl pass-through
    
    Raw character devices are supposed to pass ioctls through to the block
    devices they are bound to.  Unfortunately, they are using the wrong
    function for this: ioctl_by_bdev(), instead of blkdev_ioctl().
    
    ioctl_by_bdev() performs a set_fs(KERNEL_DS) before calling the ioctl,
    redirecting the user-space buffer access to the kernel address space.
    This is, needless to say, a bad thing.
    
    This was noticed first on s390, where raw IO was non-functioning.  The
    s390 driver config does not actually allow raw IO to be enabled, which
    was the first part of the problem.  Secondly, the s390 kernel address
    space is distinct from user, causing legal raw ioctls to fail.  I've
    reproduced this on a kernel built with 4G:4G split on x86, which fails
    in the same way (-EFAULT if the address does not exist kernel-side;
    returns success without actually populating the user buffer if it does.)
    
    The patch below fixes both the config and address-space problems.  It's
    based closely on a patch by Jan Glauber <jang@de.ibm.com>, which has
    been tested on s390 at IBM.  I've tested it on x86 4G:4G (split address
    space) and x86_64 (common address space).
    
    Kernel-address-space access has been assigned CAN-2005-1264.

    [PATCH] fix PROMISC/bridging in TLAN driver
    
    This has been a problem for me for ages.  When using bridging, the driver
    is switched into promiscuous mode before the link init is complete.  The
    init complete routine then resets the promisc bit on the card so the kernel
    still thinks the card is in promiscuous mode but the card isn't.  doh.
    
    I think this bug only shows up in bridging when the bridge is started at
    boot time (or something else that sets promisc at the same time the card
    was started).  If promisc is enabled later it works.
    
    Here's a trivial (and hopefully correct) patch that works for me. It
    just calls the promisc/multicast setup routine after init.

    [PATCH] libata: Prevent the interrupt handler from completing a command twice
    
    Problem:
       During the libata CD-ROM stress test, sometimes the "BUG: timeout
    without command" error is seen.
    
    Root cause:
      Unexpected interrupt occurs after the ata_qc_complete() is called,
    but before the SCSI error handler.  The interrupt handler is invoked
    before the SCSI error handler, and it clears the command by calling
    ata_qc_complete() again.  Later when the SCSI error handler is run,
    the ata_queued_cmd is already gone, causing the "BUG: timeout without
    command" error.
    
    Changes:
      - Use the ATA_QCFLAG_ACTIVE flag to prevent the interrupt handler
    from completing the command twice, before the scsi_error_handler.

    [PATCH] wireless/airo: WEXT and quality corrections
    
    This patch brings the airo driver into line with the current
    WEXT specification of signal quality.  It also fixes the values
    used to determine signal quality and level for MPI & PCMCIA 350
    cards.  It turns out that BSSListRid.rssi was actually in dBm
    for 350 series cards, and that we can use the normalized
    signal strength reported by the card as our "quality" value, on
    a scale of 0 - 100.  Since signal level values are in dBm for
    this driver, max_qual->level MUST be 0, as specified in the WEXT
    spec.  This patch also uses the IW_QUAL constants new in WEXT
    version 17.

    I've got a pair of FA312 cards and this problem has bothered me

    Turns out that somebody wasn't following the documentation.  We were

    [PATCH] forcedeth: Update error handling
    
    Ayaz wrote an update to the error handling for forcedeth (which I
    modified heavily, thus all bugs are mine):
    The ERROR4 bit is not a fatal error, it just indicates a mismatch
    between the actual packet len and the len according to the 802.3 header.
    The patch adds proper handling.
    The patch also removes the code that drops all packets with RX_ERROR &
    (!RX_FRAMINGERR): ERROR4 errors are also not fatal.

    [PATCH] iseries_veth: Cleanup skbs to prevent unregister_netdevice() hanging
    
    Hi Andrew, Jeff,
    
    The iseries_veth driver is badly behaved in that it will keep TX packets
    hanging around forever if they're not ACK'ed and the queue never fills up.
    
    This causes the unregister_netdevice code to wait forever when we try to take
    the device down, because there's still skbs around with references to our
    struct net_device.
    
    There's already code to cleanup any un-ACK'ed packets in veth_stop_connection()
    but it's being called after we unregister the net_device, which is too late.
    
    The fix is to rearrange the module exit function so that we cleanup any
    outstanding skbs and then unregister the driver.

    [PATCH] iseries_veth: Don't leak skbs in RX path
    
    Hi Andrew, Jeff,
    
    Under some strange circumstances the iseries_veth driver can leak skbs.
    
    Fix is simply to call dev_kfree_skb() in the right place.
    Fix up the comment as well.

    [PATCH] iseries_veth: Set dev->trans_start so watchdog timer works right
    
    Hi Andrew, Jeff,
    
    The iseries_veth driver doesn't set dev->trans_start in it's TX path. This
    will cause the net device watchdog timer to fire earlier than we want it to,
    which causes the driver to needlessly reset its connections to other LPARs.

    [PATCH] iseries_veth: Don't send packets to LPARs which aren't up
    
    Hi Andrew, Jeff,
    
    The iseries_veth driver has a logic bug which means it will erroneously
    send packets to LPARs for which we don't have a connection.
    
    This usually isn't a big problem because the Hypervisor call fails
    gracefully and we return, but if packets are TX'ed during the negotiation
    of the connection bad things might happen.
    
    Regardless, the right thing is to bail early if we know there's no
    connection.

    From: Frank Pavlic <pavlic@de.ibm.com>
    
    qeth network driver related changes:
     - due to OSA hardware changes in TCP Segmentation Offload
       support we are able now to pack TSO packets too.
       This fits perfectly in design of qeth buffer handling and
       sending data respectively.
     - remove skb_realloc_headroom from the sending path since
       hard_header_len value provides enough headroom now.
     - device recovery behaviour improvement
     - bug fixed in Enhanced Device Driver Packing functionality

    [patch 3/10] s390: set online race in the lcs driver.
    
    From: Michael Holzheu <holzheu@de.ibm.com>
    
    There is a race between lcs_stopcard() and lcs_open_device() which
    can lead to the error 'lcs: Error in starting channel, rc=-16'.
    lcs_open_device() is invoked when 'ifconfig up' is called due to a
    hotplug event, which is caused by register_netdev(). In parallel
    lcs_stopcard() is executed. Both functions are sending lcs commands.
    The second invocation fails with -EBUSY (-16) as return value.
    Move invocation of register_netdev() after invocation of lcs_stopcard
    to avoid the race.

      [PATCH] r8169: incoming frame length check
    
      The size of the incoming frame is not correctly checked.
    
      The RxMaxSize register (0xDA) does not work as expected and incoming
      frames whose size exceeds the MTU actually end spanning multiple
      descriptors. The first Rx descriptor contains the size of the whole
      frame (or some garbage in its place). The driver does not expect
      something above the space allocated to the current skb and crashes
      loudly when it issues a skb_put.
    
      The fix contains two parts:
      - disable hardware Rx size filtering: so far it only proved to be able
        to trigger some new fancy errors;
      - drop multi-descriptors frame: as the driver allocates MTU sized Rx
        buffers, it provides an adequate filtering.
    
      As a bonus, wrong descriptors were not returned to the asic after their
      processing.

    [IA64] Avoid .spillpsp directive in handcoded assembly
    
    Some time ago, GAS was fixed to bring the .spillpsp directive in line
    with the Intel assembler manual (there was some disagreement as to
    whether or not there is a built-in 16-byte offset).  Unfortunately,
    there are two places in the kernel where this directive is used in
    handwritten assembly files and those of course relied on the "buggy"
    behavior.  As a result, when using a "fixed" assembler, the kernel
    picks up the UNaT bits from the wrong place (off by 16) and randomly
    sets NaT bits on the scratch registers.  This can be noticed easily by
    looking at a coredump and finding various scratch registers with
    unexpected NaT values.  The patch below fixes this by using the
    .spillsp directive instead, which works correctly no matter what
    assembler is in use.

    I noticed this typo when trying to compile a kernel which had
    CONFIG_HOTPLUG turned off.  In that case, __devinit is no longer a
    no-op and the compiler then detects a section-conflict.  Fix by using
    __devinitdata instead of __devinit.
    
    Same patch also submitted by Darren Williams to fix compilation error

    [PATCH] uml: Fix process exit race
    
    tt-mode closes switch_pipes in exit_thread_tt and kills processes in
    switch_to_tt, if the exit_state is EXIT_DEAD or EXIT_ZOMBIE.
    
    In very rare cases the exiting process can be scheduled out after having set
    exit_state and closed switch_pipes (from release_task it calls proc_pid_flush,
    which might sleep).  If this process is to be restarted, UML failes in
    switch_to_tt with:
    
       write of switch_pipe failed, err = 9
    
    We fix this by closing switch_pipes not in exit_thread_tt, but later in
    release_thread_tt.  Additionally, we set switch_pipe[0] = 0 after closing.
    switch_to_tt must not kill "from" process depending on its exit_state, but
    must kill it after release_thread was processed only, so it examines
    switch_pipe[0] for its decision.

    [PATCH] uml: S390 preparation, peekusr/pokeusr defined by subarch
    
    s390 needs to change some parts of arch/um/kernel/ptrace.c.  Thus, the code
    regarding PEEKUSER and POKEUSER are shifted to arch/um/sys-<subarch>/ptrace.c.
    
    Also s390 debug registers need to be updated, when singlestepping is switched
    on / off.  Thus, setting/resetting of singlestepping is centralized in the new
    function set_singlestep(), which also inserts the macro
    SUBARCH_SET_SINGLESTEP(mode), if defined.
    
    Finally, s390 has the "ieee_instruction_pointer" in its
    registers, which also is allowed to be read via
    
      ptrace( PTRACE_PEEKUSER, getpid(), PT_IEEE_IP, 0);
    
    To implement this feature, sys_ptrace inserts the macro
    SUBARCH_PTRACE_SPECIAL, if defined.

    [SCSI] correct the sym2 period setting routines
    
    There's a slight bug in the routines in that if the period requires dt,
    then the routine will unconditionally set it.  DT may only be set if
    Wide is also set, so this turns back on the wide bit.
    
    For domain validation to work correctly, we need to observe the wide bit
    absolutely.

    [IA64] Fix stack placement when INIT hits in kernel mode.
    
    Without this patch, the stack is placed _below_ the current task
    structure, which is risky at best.
    
    Tony, I think this patch needs to go into 2.6.12, since it fixes a
    real bug.  Without it, INIT may case secondary errors, which would be
    most unpleasant.

    [PATCH] fix alsa via82xx resume
    
    Trying software suspend on my workstation makes it crash on resume.  The
    problem is that via82xx marks the chip_init function as _devinit, but calls
    it on resume as well.

    The defines in bootinfo.h are not used, so the include can be removed.
    According to Ben, birecs are not used on ppc64:
    
      on ppc64, we made the decision of enforcing the presence of an
      OF device-tree and either an OF-like client interface or a kexec
      like flattened tree.
      so if your bootloader want to say things to the kernel,
      it can do so by adding properties to the device-tree

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix prom.c compile warning
    
    The code in unflatten_device_tree knows that get_property is written to
    only return with lenp equal to 1 when also returning a valid pointer.
    The gcc 3.3.3 compiler is not able to prove this to itself, so it warns
    about a possible uninitialized pointer dereference:
    
     .../arch/ppc64/kernel/prom.c: In function `unflatten_device_tree':
     .../arch/ppc64/kernel/prom.c:828:
     warning: `p' might be used uninitialized in this function
    
    Unless it is desired to rework the interaction between the two
    functions, this will keep the existing behavior but quiet the compiler.

    [PATCH] bttv: fix dst i2c read/write timeout failure.
    
    Attached is a patch to bttv which fixes the following problems.
    
    Affected cards and problems:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o VP-1020 (200103A) Tuning problems, device detection.
    o VP-1020 (DST-MOT) Errors during tuning, device detection fails in a while.
    o VP-1030 (DST-CI) Tuning sometimes fails after CI commands.
    o VP-2031 (DCT-CI) Tuning problems
    
    The timeout happens before the actual timeout occured in the MCU
    on the board, and hence the problems.
    
    Changes: (bttv-i2c.diff)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    o Changed the custom wait queue to wait_event_interruptible_timeout()
          - Suggestion by Johannes Stezenbach.
    
    o Fixed the wait queue timeout problem
          - This fixes the timeout problem on various cards.
          - This problem was visible as many
              * Cannot tune to channels, when signal levels are very low.
              * app_info does not work in some conditions for CI based cards
          - Smaller values worked good for newer cards, but the older cards
    suffered, settled down to the worst case values that could happen in any
    eventuality.

    [PATCH] DAC960: add support for Mylex AcceleRAID 4/5/600
    
    This patch adds support for a new class of DAC960 controllers.  It's based
    on the GPLed idac320 driver from IBM for Linux 2.4.18.  That driver is a
    fork of the 2.4.18 version of DAC960 that adds support for this new type of
    controllers (internally called "GEM Series"), that differ from other DAC960
    V2 firmware controllers only in the register offsets and removes support
    for all others.
    
    This patch instead integrates support for these controllers into the DAC960
    driver.
    
    Thanks to Anders Norrbring for pointing me to the idac320 driver and
    testing this patch.
    
    No Signed-Off: line because all code is either copy & pasted from IBM's
    idac320 driver or support for other controllers in the 2.6 DAC960 driver.
    
    Note: the really odd formating matches the rest of the DAC960 driver.

    [PATCH] setitimer timer expires too early
    
    It seems that the code responsible for this is in kernel/itimer.c:126:
    
    	p->signal->real_timer.expires = jiffies + interval;
    	add_timer(&p->signal->real_timer);
    
    If you request an interval of, lets say 900 usecs, the interval given by
    timeval_to_jiffies will be 1.
    
    If you request this when we are half-way between two timer ticks, the
    interval will only give 400 usecs.
    
    If we want to guarantee that we never ever give intervals less than
    requested, the simple solution would be to change that to:
    
    	p->signal->real_timer.expires = jiffies + interval + 1;
    
    This however will produce pathological cases, like having a idle system
    being requested 1 ms timeouts will give systematically 2 ms timeouts,
    whereas currently it simply gives a few usecs less than 1 ms.
    
    The complex (and more computationally expensive) solution would be to
    check the gettimeofday time, and compute the correct number of jiffies.
    This way, if we request a 300 usecs timer 200 usecs inside the timer
    tick, we can wait just one tick, but not if we are 800 usecs inside the
    tick. This would also mean that we would have to lock preemption during
    these computations to avoid races, etc.
    
    I've searched the archives but couldn't find this particular issue being
    discussed before.
    
    Attached is a patch to do the simple solution, in case anybody thinks
    that it should be used.

    [PATCH] __block_write_full_page race fix
    
    When running
    	fsstress -v -d $DIR/tmp -n 1000 -p 1000 -l 2
    on an ext2 filesystem with 1024 byte block size, on SMP i386 with 4096 byte
    page size over loopback to an image file on a tmpfs filesystem, I would
    very quickly hit
    	BUG_ON(!buffer_async_write(bh));
    in fs/buffer.c:end_buffer_async_write
    
    It seems that more than one request would be submitted for a given bh
    at a time.
    
    What would happen is the following:
    2 threads doing __mpage_writepages on the same page.
    Thread 1 - lock the page first, and enter __block_write_full_page.
    Thread 1 - (eg.) mark_buffer_async_write on the first 2 buffers.
    Thread 1 - set page writeback, unlock page.
    Thread 2 - lock page, wait on page writeback
    Thread 1 - submit_bh on the first 2 buffers.
    => both requests complete, none of the page buffers are async_write,
       end_page_writeback is called.
    Thread 2 - wakes up. enters __block_write_full_page.
    Thread 2 - mark_buffer_async_write on (eg.) the last buffer
    Thread 1 - finds the last buffer has async_write set, submit_bh on that.
    Thread 2 - submit_bh on the last buffer.
    => oops.
    
    So change __block_write_full_page to explicitly keep track of the last bh
    we need to issue, so we don't touch anything after issuing the last
    request.

    [PATCH] fix race in __block_prepare_write
    
    Fix a race where __block_prepare_write can leak out an in-flight read
    against a bh if get_block returns an error.  This can lead to the page

    	fsstress -v -d $DIR/tmp -n 1000 -p 1000 -l 2
    
    where $DIR is a new ext2 filesystem with 4K blocks that is quite
    small (causing get_block to fail often with -ENOSPC).

    [PATCH] Kprobes: Incorrect handling of probes on ret/lret instruction
    
    Kprobes could not handle the insertion of a probe on the ret/lret
    instruction and used to oops after single stepping since kprobes was
    modifying eip/rip incorrectly.  Adjustment of eip/rip is not required after
    single stepping in case of ret/lret instruction, because eip/rip points to
    the correct location after execution of the ret/lret instruction.  This
    patch fixes the above problem.

    [PATCH] uml: s390 preparation, sighandler interface abstraction
    
    s390 passes parameters in registers.  So the only safe way to find out the
    address of signal context, error-address and error-type (trap_no), which are
    passed to signal handlers as parameters, is to declare these parameters.
    
    So I inserted an subarch-specific macro which holds the declaration of
    parameters for signal handlers.

    [PATCH] uml: s390 preparation, checksumming done in arch code
    
    Checksum handling largely depends on the subarch.
    
    Thus, I renamed i386 arch_csum_partial in arch/um/sys-i386/checksum.S back to
    csum_partial, removed csum_partial from arch/um/kernel/checksum.c and shifted
    EXPORT_SYMBOL(csum_partial) to arch/um/sys-i386/ksyms.c.
    
    Then, csum_partial_copy_to and csum_partial_copy_from were shifted from
    arch/um/kernel/checksum.c to arch/um/include/sysdep-i386/checksum.h and
    inserted in the calling functions csum_partial_copy_from_user() and
    csum_and_copy_to_user().
    
    Now, arch/um/kernel/checksum.c is empty and removed.

    there was a problem with deferencing tty structs after they were freed.  The
    SIGWINCH support for a tty wasn't being turned off or freed after the tty went
    away.

    [PATCH] uml: S390 preparation, abstract host page fault data
    
    This patch removes the arch-specific fault/trap-infos from thread and
    skas-regs.
    
    It adds a new struct faultinfo, that is arch-specific defined in
    sysdep/faultinfo.h.
    
    The structure is inserted in thread.arch and thread.regs.skas and
    thread.regs.tt
    
    Now, segv and other trap-handlers can copy the contents from regs.X.faultinfo
    to thread.arch.faultinfo with one simple assignment.
    
    Also, the number of macros necessary is reduced to
    
    FAULT_ADDRESS(struct faultinfo)
        extracts the faulting address from faultinfo
    
    FAULT_WRITE(struct faultinfo)
        extracts the "is_write" flag
    
    SEGV_IS_FIXABLE(struct faultinfo)
        is true for the fixable segvs, i.e. (TRAP == 14)
        on i386
    
    UPT_FAULTINFO(regs)
        result is (struct faultinfo *) to the faultinfo
        in regs->skas.faultinfo
    
    GET_FAULTINFO_FROM_SC(struct faultinfo, struct sigcontext *)
        copies the relevant parts of the sigcontext to
        struct faultinfo.
    
    On SIGSEGV, call user_signal() instead of handle_segv(), if the architecture
    provides the information needed in PTRACE_FAULTINFO, or if PTRACE_FAULTINFO is
    missing, because segv-stub will provide the info.
    
    The benefit of the change is, that in case of a non-fixable SIGSEGV, we can
    give user processes a SIGSEGV, instead of possibly looping on pagefault
    handling.
    
    Since handle_segv() sikked arch_fixup() implicitly by passing ip==0 to segv(),
    I changed segv() to call arch_fixup() only, if !is_user.

    [PATCH] uml: start cross-build support : mk_user_constants
    
    Beginning of cross-build fixes.  Instead of expecting that mk_user_constants
    (compiled and executed on the build box) will see the sizeof, etc.  for target
    box, we do what every architecture already does for asm-offsets.  Namely, have
    user-offsets.c compiled *for* *target* into user-offsets.s and sed it into the
    header with relevant constants.  We don't need to reinvent any wheels - all
    tools are already there.
    
    This patch deals with mk_user_constants.  It doesn't assume any relationship
    between target and build environment anymore - we pick all defines we need
    from user-offsets.h.  Later patches will deal with the rest of mk_...  helpers
    in the same way.

    [PATCH] x86_64: make string func definition work as intended
    
    In include/asm-x86_64/string.h there are such comments:
    
    /* Use C out of line version for memcmp */
    #define memcmp __builtin_memcmp
    int memcmp(const void * cs,const void * ct,size_t count);
    
    This would mean that if the compiler does not decide to use __builtin_memcmp,
    it emits a call to memcmp to be satisfied by the C out-of-line version in
    lib/string.c.  What happens is that after preprocessing, in lib/string.i you
    may find the definition of "__builtin_strcmp".
    
    Actually, by accident, in the object you will find the definition of strcmp
    and such (maybe a trick intended to redirect calls to __builtin_memcmp to the
    default memcmp when the definition is not expanded); however, this particular
    case is not a documented feature as far as I can see.
    
    Also, the EXPORT_SYMBOL does not work, so it's duplicated in the arch.
    
    I simply added some #undef to lib/string.c and removed the (now duplicated)

    [PATCH] uml: kludgy compilation fixes for x86-64 subarch modules support
    
    These are some trivial fixes for the x86-64 subarch module support.  The only
    potential problem is that I have to modify arch/x86_64/kernel/module.c, to
    avoid copying the whole of it.
    
    I can't use it verbatim because it depends on a special vmalloc-like area for
    modules, which for now (maybe that's to fix, I guess not) UML/x86-64 has not.
    I went the easy way and reused the i386 vmalloc()-based allocator.

    This patch does some totally trivial compilation fixes.  It also restores the

    [PATCH] ppc64: pgtable.h and other header cleanups
    
    This patch started as simply removing a few never-used macros from
    asm-ppc64/pgtable.h, then kind of grew.  It now makes a bunch of
    cleanups to the ppc64 low-level header files (with corresponding
    changes to .c files where necessary) such as:
    	- Abolishing never-used macros
    	- Eliminating multiple #defines with the same purpose
    	- Removing pointless macros (cases where just expanding the
    macro everywhere turns out clearer and more sensible)
    	- Removing some cases where macros which could be defined in
    terms of each other weren't
    	- Moving imalloc() related definitions from pgtable.h to their
    own header file (imalloc.h)
    	- Re-arranging headers to group things more logically
    	- Moving all VSID allocation related things to mmu.h, instead
    of being split between mmu.h and mmu_context.h
    	- Removing some reserved space for flags from the PMD - we're
    not using it.
    	- Fix some bugs which broke compile with STRICT_MM_TYPECHECKS.

    [PATCH] ppc32: platform-specific functions missing from kallsyms.
    
    The PPC32 kernel puts platform-specific functions into separate sections so
    that unneeded parts of it can be freed when we've booted and actually
    worked out what we're running on today.
    
    This makes kallsyms ignore those functions, because they're not between
    _[se]text or _[se]inittext.  Rather than teaching kallsyms about the
    various pmac/chrp/etc sections, this patch adds '_[se]extratext' markers
    for kallsyms.

    [PATCH] x86 stack initialisation fix
    
    The recent change fix-crash-in-entrys-restore_all.patch
    
     	childregs->esp = esp;
    
     	p->thread.esp = (unsigned long) childregs;
    -	p->thread.esp0 = (unsigned long) (childregs+1);
    +	p->thread.esp0 = (unsigned long) (childregs+1) - 8;
    
     	p->thread.eip = (unsigned long) ret_from_fork;
    
    introduces an inconsistency between esp and esp0 before the task is run the
    first time.  esp0 is no longer the actual start of the stack, but 8 bytes
    off.
    
    This shows itself clearly in a scenario when a ptracer that is set to also
    ptrace eventual children traces program1 which then clones thread1.  Now
    the ptracer wants to modify the registers of thread1.  The x86 ptrace
    implementation bases it's knowledge about saved user-space registers upon
    p->thread.esp0.  But this will be a few bytes off causing certain writes to
    the kernel stack to overwrite a saved kernel function address making the
    kernel when actually running thread1 jump out into user-space.  Very
    spectacular.
    
    The testcase I've used is:
    /* start with strace -f ./a.out */
    #include <pthread.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    void *do_thread(void *p)
    {
    	for (;;);
    }
    
    int main()
    {
    	pthread_t one;
    	pthread_create(&one, NULL, &do_thread, NULL);
    	for (;;);
    	return 0;
    }
    
    So, my solution is to instead of just adjusting esp0 that creates an
    inconsitent state I adjust where the user-space registers are saved with -8
    bytes.  This gives us the wanted extra bytes on the start of the stack and
    esp0 is now correct.  This solves the issues I saw from the original
    testcase from Mateusz Berezecki and has survived testing here.  I think
    this should go into -mm a round or two first however as there might be some
    cruft around depending on pt_regs lying on the start of the stack.  That
    however would have broken with the first change too!
    
    It's actually a 2-line diff but I had to move the comment of why the -8 bytes
    are there a few lines up. Thanks to Zwane for helping me with this.

    [PATCH] Kconfig i18n support
    
    This patch adds i18n support for make *config, allowing users to have the
    config process in their own language.
    
    No printk was harmed in the process, don't worry, so all the bug reports,
    kernel messages, etc, remain in english, just the user tools to configure
    the kernel are internationalized.
    
    Users not interested in translations can just unset the related LANG,
    LC_ALL, etc env variables and have the config process in plain english,
    something like:
    
    LANG= make menuconfig
    
    is enough for having the whole config process in english. Or just don't
    install any translation file.
    
    Translations for brazilian portuguese are being done by a team of
    volunteers at:
    
    http://www.visionflex.inf.br/kernel_ptbr/pmwiki.php/Principal/Traducoes
    
    To start the translation process:
    
      make update-po-config
    
      This will generate the pot template named scripts/kconfig/linux.pot,
      copy it to, say, ~/es.po, to start the translation for spanish.
    
    To test your translation, as root issue this command:
    
      msgfmt -o /usr/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/linux.mo ~/es.po
    
      Replace "es" with your language code.
    
      Then execute, for instance:
    
      make menuconfig
    
    The current patch doesn't use any optimization to reduce the size of the
    generated .mo file, it is possible to use the config option as a key, but
    this doesn't prevent the current patch from being used or the translations
    done under the current scheme to be in any way lost if we chose to do any
    kind of keying.
    
    Thanks to Fabricio Vaccari for starting the pt_BR (brazilian portuguese)
    translation effort, Thiago Maciera for helping me with the gconf.cc (QT
    frontent) i18n coding and to all the volunteers that are already working on
    the first translation, to pt_BR.
    
    I left the question on whether to ship the translations with the stock kernel
    sources to be discussed here, please share your suggestions.

    The premise is that domain validation is likely to trigger errors which
    it wants to know about, so the only time it should be retrying them is
    when it gets a unit attention (likely as the result of a previous bus or
    device reset).  Ironically, the previous coding retried three times in
    all cases except those of unit attention.  The attached fixes this to do
    the right thing.

    [XFS] Use the right offset when ensuring a delayed allocate conversion has covered the offset originally requested.  Can cause data corruption when multiple processes are performing writeout on different areas of the same file.  Quite difficult to hit though.

    [PATCH] ARM: Fix kernel stack offset calculations
    
    Various places in the ARM kernel implicitly assumed that kernel
    stacks are always 8K due to hard coded constants.  Replace these
    constants with definitions.
    
    Correct the allowable range of kernel stack pointer values within
    the allocation.  Arrange for the entire kernel stack to be zeroed,
    not just the upper 4K if CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE is set.

    [PATCH] drivers/base/bus.c: fix iteration in driver_detach()
    
    With 2.6.11 and 2.6.12-rc2 (and perhaps a few versions before) usb
    drivers for multi-interface devices, which do
    usb_driver_release_interface() in their disconnect(), make rmmod hang.
    
    It turns out to be due to a bug in drivers/base/bus.c:driver_detach(),
    that iterates over the list of attached devices with
    list_for_each_safe() under an assumption that device_release_driver()
    only releases the current device, while it may also call
    device_release_driver() for other devices on the same list.
    
    The following patch fixes it.  Please consider applying.

    asm-parisc/signal.h that wants its own declaration of __sighandler_t;
    that one is left as-is.
    
    asm-ppc64/signal.h required one more thing - unlike everybody else it

    [PATCH] ISA DMA Kconfig fixes - part 1
    
    A bunch of drivers use ISA DMA helpers or their equivalents for
    platforms that have ISA with different DMA controller (a lot of ARM
    boxen).  Currently there is no way to put such dependency in Kconfig -
    CONFIG_ISA is not it (e.g.  it is not set on platforms that have no ISA
    slots, but have on-board devices that pretend to be ISA ones).
    
    New symbol added - ISA_DMA_API.  Set when we have functional
    enable_dma()/set_dma_mode()/etc.  set of helpers.  Next patches in the
    series will add missing dependencies for drivers that need them.
    
    I'm very carefully staying the hell out of the recurring flamefest on
    what exactly CONFIG_ISA would mean in ideal world - added symbol has a
    well-defined meaning and for now I really want to treat it as completely
    independent from the mess around CONFIG_ISA.

    Fixed problem where setting or retreiving the serial config would fail
    with EPIPE.  Removed CRTS toggling so the driver behaves more like other
    usbserial adapters.  Issued new interval of 1ms instead of the default
    bInterval.  As a result, transfer speed has been substantially
    increased.  From avg. 850bps to avg. 3300bps.  Also added new module
    parameter 'interval' to tweak the interval in case this change causes
    problems for someone.  Cleaned up code and formatting issues so source
    is more readable.  Replaced the C++ style comments.  Various other code
    cleanups.

    Miscellaneous updates for EHCI.
    
     - Mostly updates the power switching on EHCI controllers.  One routine
       centralizes the "power on/off all ports" logic, and the capability to
       do that is reported more correctly.
    
     - Courtesy Colin Leroy, a patch to always power up ports after resumes
       which didn't keep a USB device suspended.  The reset-everything logic
       powers down those ports (on some hardware) so something needs to turn
       them back on.

    [IPSEC]: Store idev entries
    
    I found a bug that stopped IPsec/IPv6 from working.  About
    a month ago IPv6 started using rt6i_idev->dev on the cached socket dst
    entries.  If the cached socket dst entry is IPsec, then rt6i_idev will
    be NULL.
    
    Since we want to look at the rt6i_idev of the original route in this
    case, the easiest fix is to store rt6i_idev in the IPsec dst entry just
    as we do for a number of other IPv6 route attributes.  Unfortunately
    this means that we need some new code to handle the references to
    rt6i_idev.  That's why this patch is bigger than it would otherwise be.
    
    I've also done the same thing for IPv4 since it is conceivable that
    once these idev attributes start getting used for accounting, we
    probably need to dereference them for IPv4 IPsec entries too.

    [NET]: Disable queueing when carrier is lost.
    
    Some network drivers call netif_stop_queue() when detecting loss of
    carrier. This leads to packets being queued up at the qdisc level for
    an unbound period of time. In order to prevent this effect, the core
    networking stack will now cease to queue packets for any device, that
    is operationally down (i.e. the queue is flushed and disabled).

    [IA64] perfmon & PAL_HALT again
    
    The pmu_active test is based on the values of PSR.up. THIS IS THE PROBLEM as
    it does not take into account the lazy restore logic which is as follow (simplified):
    
    context switch out:
    	save PMDs
    	clear psr.up
    	release ownership
    
    context switch in:
    	if (ctx->last_cpu == smp_processor_id() && ctx->cpu_activation == cpu_activation) {
    		set psr.up
    		return
    	}
    	restore PMD
    	restore PMC
    	ctx->last_cpu   = smp_processor_id();
    	ctx->activation = ++cpu_activation;
    	set psr.up
    
    The key here is that on context switch out, we clear psr.up and on context switch in
    we check if nobody else used the PMU on that processor since last time we came. In
    that case, we assume the PMD/PMC are ours and we simply reactivate.
    
    The Caliper problem is that between the moment we context switch out and the moment we
    come back, nobody effectively used the PMU BUT the processor went idle. Normally this
    would have no incidence but PAL_HALT does alter the PMU registers.  In default_idle(),
    the test on psr.up is not strong enough to cover this case and we go into PAL which
    trashed the PMU resgisters. When we come back we falsely assume that this is our state
    yet it is corrupted. Very nasty indeed.
    
    To avoid the problem it is necessary to forbid going to PAL_HALT as soon as perfmon
    installs some valid state in the PMU registers. This happens with an application
    attaches a context to a thread or CPU. It is not enough to check the psr/dcr bits.
    Hence I propose the attached patch. It adds a callback in process.c to modify the
    condition to enter PAL on idle. Basically, now it is conditional to pal_halt=1 AND
    perfmon saying it is okay.

    [NETLINK]: Synchronous message processing.
    
    Let's recap the problem.  The current asynchronous netlink kernel
    message processing is vulnerable to these attacks:
    
    1) Hit and run: Attacker sends one or more messages and then exits
    before they're processed.  This may confuse/disable the next netlink
    user that gets the netlink address of the attacker since it may
    receive the responses to the attacker's messages.
    
    Proposed solutions:
    
    a) Synchronous processing.
    b) Stream mode socket.
    c) Restrict/prohibit binding.
    
    2) Starvation: Because various netlink rcv functions were written
    to not return until all messages have been processed on a socket,
    it is possible for these functions to execute for an arbitrarily
    long period of time.  If this is successfully exploited it could
    also be used to hold rtnl forever.
    
    Proposed solutions:
    
    a) Synchronous processing.
    b) Stream mode socket.
    
    Firstly let's cross off solution c).  It only solves the first
    problem and it has user-visible impacts.  In particular, it'll
    break user space applications that expect to bind or communicate
    with specific netlink addresses (pid's).
    
    So we're left with a choice of synchronous processing versus
    SOCK_STREAM for netlink.
    
    For the moment I'm sticking with the synchronous approach as
    suggested by Alexey since it's simpler and I'd rather spend
    my time working on other things.
    
    However, it does have a number of deficiencies compared to the
    stream mode solution:
    
    1) User-space to user-space netlink communication is still vulnerable.
    
    2) Inefficient use of resources.  This is especially true for rtnetlink
    since the lock is shared with other users such as networking drivers.
    The latter could hold the rtnl while communicating with hardware which
    causes the rtnetlink user to wait when it could be doing other things.
    
    3) It is still possible to DoS all netlink users by flooding the kernel
    netlink receive queue.  The attacker simply fills the receive socket
    with a single netlink message that fills up the entire queue.  The
    attacker then continues to call sendmsg with the same message in a loop.
    
    Point 3) can be countered by retransmissions in user-space code, however
    it is pretty messy.
    
    In light of these problems (in particular, point 3), we should implement
    stream mode netlink at some point.  In the mean time, here is a patch
    that implements synchronous processing.

    [NETLINK]: cb_lock does not needs ref count on sk
    
    Here is a little optimisation for the cb_lock used by netlink_dump.
    While fixing that race earlier, I noticed that the reference count
    held by cb_lock is completely useless.  The reason is that in order
    to obtain the protection of the reference count, you have to take
    the cb_lock.  But the only way to take the cb_lock is through
    dereferencing the socket.
    
    That is, you must already possess a reference count on the socket
    before you can take advantage of the reference count held by cb_lock.
    As a corollary, we can remve the reference count held by the cb_lock.

    The patch "MCA recovery improvements" added do_exit to mca_drv.c.
    That's fine when the mca recovery code is built in the kernel
    (CONFIG_IA64_MCA_RECOVERY=y) but breaks building the mca recovery
    code as a module (CONFIG_IA64_MCA_RECOVERY=m).
    
    Most users are currently building this as a module, as loading
    and unloading the module provides a very convenient way to turn
    on/off error recovery.
    
    This patch exports do_exit, so mca_drv.c can build as a module.

    [IA64] MCA recovery improvements
    
    Jack Steiner uncovered some opportunities for improvement in
    the MCA recovery code.
    
      1) Set bsp to save registers on the kernel stack.
      2) Disable interrupts while in the MCA recovery code.
      3) Change the way the user process is killed, to avoid
         a panic in schedule.
    
    Testing shows that these changes make the recovery code much
    more reliable with the 2.6.12 kernel.

    [IA64] fix ia64 syscall auditing
    
    Attached is a patch against David's audit.17 kernel that adds checks
    for the TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT thread flag to the ia64 system call and
    signal handling code paths.  The patch enables auditing of system
    calls set up via fsys_bubble_down, as well as ensuring that
    audit_syscall_exit() is called on return from sigreturn.
    
    Neglecting to check for TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT at these points results in
    incorrect information in audit_context, causing frequent system panics
    when system call auditing is enabled on an ia64 system.
    
    I have tested this patch and have seen no problems with it.

    which we normally exit pm_idle from.  So switch to a percpu variable.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix gcc 4.0 vs CONFIG_ALTIVEC
    
    gcc-4.0 generates altivec code implicitly when -mcpu indicates an
    altivec capable CPU which is not suitable for the kernel.  However, we
    used to set -mcpu=970 when CONFIG_ALTIVEC was set because a gcc-3.x bug
    prevented from using -maltivec along with -mcpu=power4, thus prevented
    building the RAID6 altivec code.
    
    This patch fixes all of this by testing for the gcc version.  If 4.0 or
    later, just normally use -mcpu=power4 and let the RAID6 code add
    -maltivec to the few files it needs to be compiled with altivec support.
    For 3.x, we still use -mcpu=970 to work around the above problem, which
    is fine as 3.x will never implicitly generate altivec code.
    
    The Makefile hackery may not be the most lovely, I welcome anybody more
    skilled than me to improve it.

    the audit message has already been fragmented to multiple skb's, the search

    create a new extent that overlaps the next one.

    [PATCH] JFS: Write journal sync points more often
    
    This patch adds jfs_syncpt, which calls lmLogSync to write sync points
    to the journal both in jfs_sync_fs and when sync barrier processing
    completes.
    
    lmLogSync accomplishes two things:  1) it pushes logged-but-dirty
    metadata pages to disk, and 2) it writes a sync record to the journal
    so that jfs_fsck doesn't need to replay more transactions than is
    necessary.

    [PATCH] JFS: Simplify creation of new iag
    
    JFS was creating a new IAG (inode aggregate group) in one address
    space, and afterwards, accessing it from another.  This could lead to
    complications when cache pages contain more than one page of jfs
    metadata.  This patch causes the IAG to be initialized in the same
    address space that it is subsequently accessed with.
    
    This also elimitates an I/O, but IAG's aren't created too often.

    [PATCH] JFS: reduce number of synchronous transactions
    
    Use an inline pxd list rather than an xad list in the xadlock.
    When the number of extents being modified can fit with the xadlock,
    a transaction can be committed asynchronously.  Using a list of
    pxd's instead of xad's allows us to fit 4 extents, rather than 2.

    [PATCH] cpufreq annoying warning fix
    
    The cpufreq core patch I sent earlier got only half-applied.  I added a
    flag to let the low level driver disable an annoying warning on
    suspend/resume that is normal on ppc, but the "resume" part of it wasn't
    applied.
    
    This just adds back that missing bit.  The original patch also reworked
    the resume() function to avoid nesting too many if () statements along
    the way I did the suspend() one, but I didn't include that in the patch
    below.

    [PATCH] DocBook: changes and extensions to the kernel documentation
    
    I have recompiled Linux kernel 2.6.11.5 documentation for me and our
    university students again.  The documentation could be extended for more
    sources which are equipped by structured comments for recent 2.6 kernels.  I
    have tried to proceed with that task.  I have done that more times from 2.6.0
    time and it gets boring to do same changes again and again.  Linux kernel
    compiles after changes for i386 and ARM targets.  I have added references to
    some more files into kernel-api book, I have added some section names as well.
     So please, check that changes do not break something and that categories are
    not too much skewed.
    
    I have changed kernel-doc to accept "fastcall" and "asmlinkage" words reserved
    by kernel convention.  Most of the other changes are modifications in the
    comments to make kernel-doc happy, accept some parameters description and do
    not bail out on errors.  Changed <pid> to @pid in the description, moved some
    #ifdef before comments to correct function to comments bindings, etc.
    
    You can see result of the modified documentation build at
      http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~pisa/linux/lkdb-2.6.11.tar.gz
    
    Some more sources are ready to be included into kernel-doc generated
    documentation.  Sources has been added into kernel-api for now.  Some more
    section names added and probably some more chaos introduced as result of quick
    cleanup work.

    [PATCH] intelfb: Remove intelfbdrv.h
    
    Ingo Oeser noticed that all that intelfbdrv.h contains are prototypes for
    static functions - and such prototypes don't belong into header files.
    
    This patch therefore removes drivers/video/intelfb/intelfbdrv.h and moves the
    prototypes to intelfbdrv.c .

    [PATCH] ext3: remove unnecessary race then retry in ext3_get_block
    
    The extra race-with-truncate-then-retry logic around
    ext3_get_block_handle(), which was inherited from ext2, becomes unecessary
    for ext3, since we have already obtained the ei->truncate_sem in
    ext3_get_block_handle() before calling ext3_alloc_branch().  The
    ei->truncate_sem is already there to block concurrent truncate and block
    allocation on the same inode.  So the inode's indirect addressing tree
    won't be changed after we grab that semaphore.
    
    We could, after get the semaphore, re-verify the branch is up-to-date or
    not.  If it has been changed, then get the updated branch.  If we still
    need block allocation, we will have a safe version of the branch to work
    with in the ext3_find_goal()/ext3_splice_branch().
    
    The code becomes more readable after remove those retry logic.  The patch
    also clean up some gotos in ext3_get_block_handle() to make it more
    readable.

    [PATCH] reiserfs endianness: sanitize reiserfs_key union
    
    Since we only access reiserfs_key ->u.k_offset_v2 guts in four helper
    functions, we are free to sanitize those, as long as
    
    - layout of the structure is unchanged (it's on-disk object)
    
    - behaviour of these helpers is same as before.
    
    Patch kills the mess with endianness-dependent bitfields and replaces them
    with a single __le64.  Helpers are switched to straightforward shift/and/or.
    
    Benefits:
    
    - exact same definitions for little- and big-endian architectures; no ifdefs
      in sight.
    
    - generate the same code on little-endian and improved on big-endian.
    
    - doesn't rely on lousy bitfields handling in gcc codegenerator.
    
    - happens to be standard C (unsigned long long is not a valid type for a
      bitfield; it's a gccism and not well-implemented one, at that).

    [PATCH] reiserfs endianness: comp_short_keys() cleanup
    
    comp_short_keys() massaged into sane form, which kills the last place where
    pointer to in_core_key (or any object containing such) would be cast to or
    from something else.  At that point we are free to change layout of
    in_core_key - nothing depends on it anymore.
    
    So we drop the mess with union in there and simply use (unconditional) __u64
    k_offset and __u8 k_type instead; places using in_core_key switched to those.
    That gives _far_ better code than current mess - on all platforms.

    The same variables will be initialized at the kiocb allocation time,
    so why bother reset them knowing that they will be set to valid data
    at alloc time?  Another example: ki_retry is initialized in __aio_get_req,
    but is initialized again in io_submit_one.

    [PATCH] new valid_signal() function
    
    This patch adds a new function valid_signal() that tests if its argument is
    a valid signal number.
    
    The reasons for adding this new function are:
    
    - some code currently testing _NSIG directly has off-by-one errors.
      Using this function instead avoids such errors.
    
    - some code currently tests unsigned signal numbers for <0 which is
      pointless and generates warnings when building with gcc -W.  Using this
      function instead avoids such warnings.
    
    I considered various places to add this function but eventually settled on
    include/linux/signal.h as the most logical place for it.  If there's some
    reason this is a bad choice then please let me know (hints as to a better
    location are then welcome of course).

    [PATCH] ipmi: enable interrupts on the BT driver
    
    Enable interrupts for a BT interface.  There is a specific register that
    needs to be set up to enable interrupts that also must be modified to clear
    the irq.
    
    Also, don't reset the BMC on a BT interface.  That's probably not a good
    idea as the BMC may be performing other important functions and a reset
    should only be a last resort.  Also, that register is also used to
    enable/disable interrupts to the BT; modifying it may screw up the
    interrupts.

    There were still a few comments left refering to verify_area, and two
    functions, verify_area_skas & verify_area_tt that just wrap corresponding
    access_ok_skas & access_ok_tt functions, just like verify_area does for
    access_ok - deprecate those.
    
    There was also a few places that still used verify_area in commented-out
    code, fix those up to use access_ok.
    
    After applying this one there should not be anything left but finally
    removing verify_area completely, which will happen after a kernel release
    or two.

    [PATCH] vgacon: set vc_hi_font_mask correctly
    
    When allocating a new VC with vgacon_init(), the font is shared across all
    the VGA consoles.  However, the font mask was always set to the default
    value of zero in visual_init(), even if we were using 512 character fonts
    at the time.
    
    Moreover, code in vgacon.c:vga_do_font_op() didn't reset the mask if the
    console driver thinks it's already in 512 character mode.  This means that
    to *fix* it, you'd actually have to take the console out of 512 character
    mode and then set it back.
    
    The attached sets vc_hi_font_mask in vgacon_init() for any new consoles
    opened if the vgacon driver is already in 512 character mode, solving this.
    
    This bug goes back to 2.4.18 at least, probably earlier.

    [PATCH] LifeView FlyTV Platinum FM: GPIO usage
    
    This is take two of a patch that should have appeared two days ago, before
    yesterday's "remote control" patch for the same card.
    
    This patch sets unconnected GPIO to Output to keep them from floating (just
    good driver writing practice, being nice to the chip), and uses GPIO16 to
    switch TV vs.  FM - this pin switches inputs onto the tuner, as well as the
    audio output from the tuner into the 7135 SIF input.  Consequently, FM
    radio support is being un-commented because it's now working (sort of, see
    below).
    
    These two patches get the card almost fully operational; there appears to
    be a bug in tda8290.c remaining that puts an offset onto the tuned
    frequency in FM radio mode.  We're investigating.

    [PATCH] reiserfs: make resize option auto-get new device size
    
    It's trivial for the resize option to auto-get the underlying device size,
    while it's harder for the user.  I've copied the code from jfs.
    
    Since of the different reiserfs option parser (which does not use the
    superior match_token used by almost every other filesystem), I've had to
    use the "resize=auto" and not "resize" option to specify this behaviour.
    Changing the option parser to the kernel one wouldn't be bad but I've no
    time to do this cleanup in this moment.
    
    Btw, the mount(8) man page should be updated to include this option.  Cc
    the relevant people, please (I hope I cc'ed the right people).

    [PATCH] Deprecate synchronize_kernel, GPL replacement
    
    The synchronize_kernel() primitive is used for quite a few different purposes:
    waiting for RCU readers, waiting for NMIs, waiting for interrupts, and so on.
    This makes RCU code harder to read, since synchronize_kernel() might or might

    [PATCH] kernel/rcupdate.c: make the exports EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
    
    The gpl exports need to be put back.  Moving them to GPL -- but in a
    measured manner, as I proposed on this list some months ago -- is fine.
    Changing these particular exports precipitously is most definitely -not-
    fine.  Here is my earlier proposal:
    
    	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110520930301813&w=2
    
    See below for a patch that puts the exports back, along with an updated
    version of my earlier patch that starts the process of moving them to GPL.
    I will also be following this message with RFC patches that introduce two
    (EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL) interfaces to replace synchronize_kernel(), which then
    becomes deprecated.

    [PATCH] procfs: Fix hardlink counts for /proc/<PID>/task
    
    The current logic assumes that a /proc/<PID>/task directory should have a
    hardlink count of 3, probably counting ".", "..", and a directory for a
    single child task.
    
    It's fairly obvious that this doesn't work out correctly when a PID has
    more than one child task, which is quite often the case.

    [PATCH] procfs: Fix hardlink counts
    
    The pid directories in /proc/ currently return the wrong hardlink count - 3,
    when there are actually 4 : ".", "..", "fd", and "task".
    
    This is easy to notice using find(1):
    	cd /proc/<pid>
    	find
    
    In the output, you'll see a message similar to:
    
    find: WARNING: Hard link count is wrong for .: this may be a bug in your
    filesystem driver.  Automatically turning on find's -noleaf option.
    Earlier results may have failed to include directories that should have
    been searched.
    
    http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86031
    
    I also noticed that CONFIG_SECURITY can add a 5th: attr, and performed a
    similar fix on the task directories too.

    [PATCH] move SA_xxx defines to linux/signal.h
    
    The attached patch moves the IRQ-related SA_xxx flags (namely, SA_PROBE,
    SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM and SA_SHIRQ) from all the arch-specific headers to
    linux/signal.h.  This looks like a left-over after the irq-handling code
    was consolidated.  The code was moved to kernel/irq/*, but the flags are
    still left per-arch.
    
    Right now, adding a new IRQ flag to the arch-specific header, like this
    patch does:
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/alsa/alsa-driver/utils/patches/pcsp-kernel-2.6.10-03.diff?rev=1.1
    no longer works, it breaks the compilation for all other arches, unless you
    add that flag to all the other arch-specific headers too.  So I think such
    a clean-up makes sense.

    Add a pair of rlimits for allowing non-root tasks to raise nice and rt
    priorities. Defaults to traditional behavior. Originally written by
    Chris Wright.
    
    The patch implements a simple rlimit ceiling for the RT (and nice) priorities
    a task can set.  The rlimit defaults to 0, meaning no change in behavior by
    default.  A value of 50 means RT priority levels 1-50 are allowed.  A value of
    100 means all 99 privilege levels from 1 to 99 are allowed.  CAP_SYS_NICE is
    blanket permission.

    [PATCH] s390: fix memory holes and cleanup setup_arch
    
    The memory setup didn't take care of memory holes and this makes the memory
    management think there would be more memory available than there is in
    reality.  That causes the OOM killer to kill processes even if there is enough
    memory left that can be written to the swap space.
    
    The patch fixes this by using free_area_init_node with an array of memory
    holes instead of free_area_init.  Further the patch cleans up the code in
    setup.c by splitting setup_arch into smaller pieces.

    Split the i386 entry.S files into entry.S and syscall_table.S which is

    and use the syscall_table.S in the UML build, instead of tracking by hand the
    syscall table changes (which is inherently error-prone).
    
    We must only insert the right #defines to inject the changes we need from the
    i386 syscall table (for instance some different function names); also, we
    don't implement some i386 syscalls, as ioperm(), nor some TLS-related ones
    (yet to provide).

    [PATCH] uml: move va_copy conditional def
    
    GCC 2.95 uses __va_copy instead of va_copy.  Handle it inside compiler.h
    instead of in a casual file, and avoid the risk that this breaks with a newer

    [PATCH] uml: support AES i586 crypto driver
    
    We want to make possible, for the user, to enable the i586 AES implementation.
    This requires a restructure.
    
    - Add a CONFIG_UML_X86 to notify that we are building a UML for i386.
    
    - Rename CONFIG_64_BIT to CONFIG_64BIT as is used for all other archs
    
    - Tell crypto/Kconfig that UML_X86 is as good as X86
    
    - Tell it that it must exclude not X86_64 but 64BIT, which will give the
      same results.
    
    - Tell kbuild to descend down into arch/i386/crypto/ to build what's needed.

    [PATCH] uml: fix oops related to exception table
    
          Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
    
    Prevent the kernel from oopsing during the extable sorting, as it can do
    now, because the extable is in the readonly section of the binary.
    
    Jeff says: The exception table turned RO in 2.6.11-rc3-mm1 for some reason.
    Moving it causes it to land in the writable data section of the binary.
    
    Paolo says: This patch fixes a oops on startup, which can be easily
    triggered by compiling with CONFIG_MODE_TT disabled, and STATIC_LINK either
    disabled or enabled.  The resulting kernel will always Oops on startup,
    after printing this simple output:
    
    I've verified, by binary search on the BitKeeper repository (synced up as
    of 2.6.12-rc2), starting from the range 2.6.11-2.6.12-rc1, that this bug
    shows up on BitKeeper revisions in the range [@1.1994.11.168,+inf), i.e.

    [PATCH] Linux 2.6.x VM86 interrupt emulation fixes
    
    Patch solves VM86 interrupt emulation deadlock on SMP systems.  The VM86
    interrupt emulation has been heavily tested and works well on UP systems
    after last update, but it seems to deadlock when we have used it on SMP/HT
    boxes now.
    
    It seems, that disable_irq() cannot be called from interrupts, because it
    waits until disabled interrupt handler finishes
    (/kernel/irq/manage.c:synchronize_irq():while(IRQ_INPROGRESS);).  This
    blocks one CPU after another.  Solved by use disable_irq_nosync.
    
    There is the second problem.  If IRQ source is fast, it is possible, that
    interrupt is sometimes processed and re-enabled by the second CPU, before
    it is disabled by the first one, but negative IRQ disable depths are not
    allowed.  The spinlocking and disabling IRQs over call to
    disable_irq_nosync/enable_irq is the only solution found reliable till now.

    [PATCH] Increase number of e820 entries hard limit from 32 to 128
    
    The specifications that talk about E820 map doesn't have an upper limit on
    the number of e820 entries.  But, today's kernel has a hard limit of 32.
    With increase in memory size, we are seeing the number of E820 entries
    reaching close to 32.  Patch below bumps the number upto 128.
    
    The patch changes the location of EDDBUF in zero-page (as it comes after E820).
    As, EDDBUF is not used by boot loaders, this patch should not have any effect
    on bootloader-setup code interface.
    
    Patch covers both i386 and x86-64.
    
    Tested on:
    * grub booting bzImage
    * lilo booting bzImage with EDID info enabled
    * pxeboot of bzImage
    
    Side-effect:
    bss increases by ~ 2K and init.data increases by ~7.5K
    on all systems, due to increase in size of static arrays.

    [PATCH] i386: fix hpet for systems that don't support legacy replacement
    
    Currently the i386 HPET code assumes the entire HPET implementation from
    the spec is present.  This breaks on boxes that do not implement the
    optional legacy timer replacement functionality portion of the spec.
    
    This patch, which is very similar to my x86-64 patch for the same issue,
    fixes the problem allowing i386 systems that cannot use the HPET for the
    timer interrupt and RTC to still use the HPET as a time source.  I've
    tested this patch on a system systems without HPET, with HPET but without
    legacy timer replacement, as well as HPET with legacy timer replacement.

    [PATCH] check nmi watchdog is broken
    
    A bug against an xSeries system showed up recently noting that the
    check_nmi_watchdog() test was failing.
    
    I have been investigating it and discovered in both i386 and x86_64 the
    recent change to the routine to use the cpu_callin_map has uncovered a
    problem.  Prior to that change, on an SMP box, the test was trivally
    passing because all cpu's were found to not yet be online, but now with the
    callin_map they are discovered, it goes on to test the counter and they
    have not yet begun to increment, so it announces a CPU is stuck and bails
    out.
    
    On all the systems I have access to test, the announcement of failure is
    also bougs...  by the time you can login and check /proc/interrupts, the
    NMI count is happily incrementing on all CPUs.  Its just that the test is
    being done too early.
    
    I have tried moving the call to the test around a bit, and it was always
    too early.  I finally hit on this proposed solution, it delays the routine
    via a late_initcall(), seems like the right solution to me.

    [PATCH] i386/x86_64 segment register access update
    
    The new i386/x86_64 assemblers no longer accept instructions for moving
    between a segment register and a 32bit memory location, i.e.,
    
            movl (%eax),%ds
            movl %ds,(%eax)
    
    To generate instructions for moving between a segment register and a
    16bit memory location without the 16bit operand size prefix, 0x66,
    
            mov (%eax),%ds
            mov %ds,(%eax)
    
    should be used. It will work with both new and old assemblers. The
    assembler starting from 2.16.90.0.1 will also support
    
            movw (%eax),%ds
            movw %ds,(%eax)
    
    without the 0x66 prefix. I am enclosing patches for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels
    here. The resulting kernel binaries should be unchanged as before, with
    old and new assemblers, if gcc never generates memory access for
    
                   unsigned gsindex;
                   asm volatile("movl %%gs,%0" : "=g" (gsindex));
    
    If gcc does generate memory access for the code above, the upper bits
    in gsindex are undefined and the new assembler doesn't allow it.

    [PATCH] ppc64: reverse prediction on spinlock busy loop code
    
    On our raw spinlocks, we currently have an attempt at the lock, and if we do
    not get it we enter a spin loop.  This spinloop will likely continue for
    awhile, and we pridict likely.
    
    Shouldn't we predict that we will get out of the loop so our next instructions
    are already prefetched.  Even when we miss because the lock is still held, it
    won't matter since we are waiting anyways.
    
    I did a couple quick benchmarks, but the results are inconclusive.

    Anton said:
    
    Mispredicting the spinlock busy loop also means we slow down the rate at which
    we do the loads which can be good for heavily contended locks.
    
    Note: There are some gcc issues with our default build and branch prediction,
    but a CONFIG_POWER4_ONLY build should emit them correctly.  I'm working with
    Alan Modra on it now.

    [PATCH] ppc64: noexec fixes
    
    There were a few issues with the ppc64 noexec support:
    
    The 64bit ABI has a non executable stack by default.  At the moment 64bit apps
    require a PT_GNU_STACK section in order to have a non executable stack.
    
    Disable the read implies exec workaround on the 64bit ABI.  The 64bit
    toolchain has never had problems with incorrect mmap permissions (the 32bit
    has, thats why we need to retain the workaround).
    
    With these fixes as well as a gcc fix from Alan Modra (that was recently
    committed) 64bit apps work as expected.

    [PATCH] PPC64: Remove hot busy-wait loop in __hash_page
    
    It turns out that our current __hash_page code will do a very hot busy-wait
    loop waiting on _PAGE_BUSY to be cleared.  It even does ldarx/stdcx in the
    loop, which will bounce reservations around like crazy if there's more than
    one CPU spinning on the same PTE (or even another PTE in the same
    reservation granule).  The end result is that each fault takes longer when
    there's contention, which in turn increases the chance of another thread
    hitting the same fault and also piling up.  Not pretty.
    
    There's two options here:
    1. Do an out-of-line busy loop a'la spinlocks with just loads (no
       reserves)
    2. Just bail and refault if needed.
    
    (2) makes sense here: If the PTE is busy, chances are it's in flux anyway
    and the other code path making a change might just be ready to hash it.
    
    This fixes a stampede seen on a large-ish system where a multithreaded
    HPC app faults in the same text pages on several cpus at the same time.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix irq parsing on powermac
    
    When I tried Ben's patches to the powermac sound driver on my G5, I found
    that it was taking enormous numbers of sound DMA transmit interrupts.  This
    turned out to be because it was incorrectly configured as level-sensitive
    instead of edge-sensitive, which in turn was because the code that parses
    the interrupt tree that Open Firmware gives us was incorrectly assigning
    another device the same irq number as the sound DMA transmit interrupt
    (i.e.  1).
    
    This patch fixes the problem, in a somewhat quick and dirty way for now,
    but one which will work for all the machines we currently run on.
    Ultimately Ben and I want to do something more general and robust, but this
    should go in for 2.6.12.

    [PATCH] ppc64: add PT_NOTE section to vDSO
    
    This patch from Roland adds a PT_NOTE section to both 32 and 64 bits vDSOs
    to expose the kernel version to glibc, thus avoiding a uname syscall on
    every launch.  This is equivalent to the patches Roland posted already for
    x86 and x86-64.
    
    Note: the 64 bits .note is actually using the 32 bits format.  This is
    normal.  The ELF spec specifies a different format for 64 bits .note, but
    for some reason, this was never properly implemented, the core dumps for
    example are all using 32 bits format .note, and binutils cannot even read a
    64 bits format .note.  Talking to our toolchain folks, they think we'd
    rather stick to 32 bits format .note everywhere and get the spec fixed some
    day ...

    [PATCH] pmac: save master volume on sleep
    
    Ben's patch that shutdowns master switch and restores it after resume
    ("pmac: Improve sleep code of tumbler driver") isn't enough here on an

    The master switch is correctly saved and restored, but somehow
    tumbler_put_master_volume() gets called just after
    tumbler_set_master_volume() and sets mix->master_vol[*] to 0.  So, on
    resuming, the master switch is reenabled, but the volume is set to 0.
    
    Here's a patch that also saves and restores master_vol.

    This patch fixes is by disabling the irq in the ide pmac driver while
    asleep and only re-enable it after the chip has been fully reset.  This is
    safe to do so as the interrupt of these apple IDE cells is never shared.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix errata for some G3 CPUs
    
    Some G3 CPUs can crash in funny way if a store from an FPU register
    instruction is executed on a register that has never been initialized since
    power on.  This patch fixes it by making sure all FP registers have been
    properly initialized at kernel boot and when waking from sleep.  It also makes
    the code that decides wether HID0_BTIC and HID0_DPM are allowed on a given CPU
    smarter (it can actually _clear_ them now if they are not allowed instead of
    just setting them when they are allowed in case the firmware got them wrong)

    [PATCH] SELinux: add finer grained permissions to Netlink audit processing
    
    This patch provides finer grained permissions for the audit family of
    Netlink sockets under SELinux.
    
    1.  We need a way to differentiate between privileged and unprivileged
       reads of kernel data maintained by the audit subsystem.  The AUDIT_GET
       operation is unprivileged: it returns the current status of the audit
       subsystem (e.g.  whether it's enabled etc.).  The AUDIT_LIST operation
       however returns a list of the current audit ruleset, which is considered
       privileged by the audit folk.  To deal with this, a new SELinux
       permission has been implemented and applied to the operation:
       nlmsg_readpriv, which can be allocated to appropriately privileged
       domains.  Unprivileged domains would only be allocated nlmsg_read.
    
    2.  There is a requirement for certain domains to generate audit events
       from userspace.  These events need to be collected by the kernel,
       collated and transmitted sequentially back to the audit daemon.  An
       example is user level login, an auditable event under CAPP, where
       login-related domains generate AUDIT_USER messages via PAM which are
       relayed back to auditd via the kernel.  To prevent handing out
       nlmsg_write permissions to such domains, a new permission has been
       added, nlmsg_relay, which is intended for this type of purpose: data is
       passed via the kernel back to userspace but no privileged information is
       written to the kernel.
    
    Also, AUDIT_LOGIN messages are now valid only for kernel->user messaging,
    so this value has been removed from the SELinux nlmsgtab (which is only
    used to check user->kernel messages).

    This patch removes the sclass argument from ipc_has_perm in the SELinux
    module, as it can be obtained from the ipc security structure.  The use of

    [PATCH] add kmalloc_node, inline cleanup
    
    The patch makes the following function calls available to allocate memory
    on a specific node without changing the basic operation of the slab
    allocator:
    
     kmem_cache_alloc_node(kmem_cache_t *cachep, unsigned int flags, int node);
     kmalloc_node(size_t size, unsigned int flags, int node);
    
    in a similar way to the existing node-blind functions:
    
     kmem_cache_alloc(kmem_cache_t *cachep, unsigned int flags);
     kmalloc(size, flags);
    
    kmem_cache_alloc_node was changed to pass flags and the node information
    through the existing layers of the slab allocator (which lead to some minor
    rearrangements).  The functions at the lowest layer (kmem_getpages,
    cache_grow) are already node aware.  Also __alloc_percpu can call
    kmalloc_node now.
    
    Performance measurements (using the pageset localization patch) yields:

    This is a patch for counting the number of pages for bounce buffers.  It's

    Currently, the number of bounce pages are not counted anywhere.  So, if
    there are many bounce pages, it seems that there are leaked pages.  And
    it's difficult for a user to imagine the usage of bounce pages.  So, it's
    meaningful to show # of bouce pages.

    [PATCH] mempool: simplify alloc
    
    Mempool is pretty clever.  Looks too clever for its own good :) It
    shouldn't really know so much about page reclaim internals.
    
    - don't guess about what effective page reclaim might involve.
    
    - don't randomly flush out all dirty data if some unlikely thing
      happens (alloc returns NULL). page reclaim can (sort of :P) handle
      it.
    
    I think the main motivation is trying to avoid pool->lock at all costs.
    However the first allocation is attempted with __GFP_WAIT cleared, so it
    will be 'can_try_harder' if it hits the page allocator.  So if allocation
    still fails, then we can probably afford to hit the pool->lock - and what's
    the alternative?  Try page reclaim and hit zone->lru_lock?
    
    A nice upshot is that we don't need to do any fancy memory barriers or do
    (intentionally) racy access to pool-> fields outside the lock.

    [PATCH] mempool: NOMEMALLOC and NORETRY
    
    Mempools have 2 problems.
    
    The first is that mempool_alloc can possibly get stuck in __alloc_pages
    when they should opt to fail, and take an element from their reserved pool.
    
    The second is that it will happily eat emergency PF_MEMALLOC reserves
    instead of going to their reserved pools.
    
    Fix the first by passing __GFP_NORETRY in the allocation calls in
    mempool_alloc.  Fix the second by introducing a __GFP_MEMPOOL flag which
    directs the page allocator not to allocate from the reserve pool.

    [PATCH] kbuild/i386: re-introduce dependency on vmlinux for install target, and add kernel_install
    
    Removing the dependency on vmlinux for the install target raised a few
    complaints, so instead a new target i added: kernel_install.
    
    kernel_install will install the kernel just like the ordinary install target.
    The only difference is that install has a dependency on vmlinux,
    kernel_install does not. Therefore kernel_install is the best choice
    when accessing the kernel over a NFS mount or as another user.
    
    kernel_install is similar to modules_install in the fact that neither does
    a full kernel compile before performing the install.
    In this way they are good for root use. Also added back the
    dependency on vmlinux for the install target so peoples scripts are no
    longer broken.

    [PATCH] ppc64: fix 32-bit signal frame back link
    
    When the kernel creates a signal frame on the user stack, it puts the
    old stack pointer value at the beginning so that the signal frame is
    linked into the chain of stack frames like any other frame.
    Unfortunately, for 32-bit processes we are writing the old stack
    pointer as a 64-bit value rather than a 32-bit value, and the process
    sees that as a null pointer, since it only looks at the first 32 bits,
    which are zero since ppc is bigendian and the stack pointer is below
    4GB.  This bug is in SLES9 and RHEL4 too, hence the ccs.
    
    This patch fixes the bug by making the signal code write the old stack
    pointer as a u32 instead of an unsigned long.

    [PATCH] ARM: 2660/2: fix ixdp2800 boot and pci init
    
    Patch from Lennert Buytenhek
    
    The IXDP2800 is an evalution platform for the IXP2800 processor that
    has two IXP2800s connected to the same PCI bus.  This is problematic
    as both CPUs will try to configure the PCI bus as they boot linux.
    Contrary to on the other IXP2000 platforms, the boot loader on the
    IXDP2800 doesn't configure the PCI bus properly, so we do want the
    linux instance on one of the CPUs to do that.
    Making one of the CPUs ignore the PCI bus (and thus act like a pure
    PCI slave device) is not an option because there is a 82559 NIC on
    the PCI bus for each of the CPUs.
    The chosen solution is to have the master CPU configure the PCI bus
    while the slave is kept in a quiescent state, and then to have the
    slave CPU scan the PCI bus (without assigning resources) while the
    master is kept in a quiescent state.  After this ritual, the master
    deletes the slave NIC from its PCI device list, the slave deletes
    the master NIC from its device list, and (almost) all is well.
    There's still one little problem: each of the CPUs has a 1G SDRAM
    BAR, but the IXP2000 only has 512M of outbound PCI memory window.
    We solve this by hand-assigning the master and slave SDRAM BARs to
    a location outside each of the IXP's outbound PCI windows, and by
    having the rest of the BARs autoconfigured in the outbound PCI
    windows, in the range [e0000000..ffffffff], so that there is a 1:1
    pci:phys mapping between them.
    Even with this patch, a number of issues still remain -- just imagine
    what happens if one of the CPUs is rebooted, by watchdog or by hand,
    but the other one isn't.  But those issues are not easily fixable
    given the strange PCI layout of this board and the behavior of the
    boot loader shipped with the platform.

    This patch is required for kernel XIP support on ARMv6 machines.  It ensures that the access permission bits for kernel XIP section descriptors are APX=1 and AP[1:0]=01, which is Kernel read-only/User no access permissions.  Prior to this change, kernel XIP section descriptor access permissions were set to Kernel no access/User no access on ARMv6 machines and the kernel would therefore hang upon entry to userspace when set_fs(USER_DS) was executed.

    On ARM, the outX() and writeX() families of macros take the

    [PATCH] ARM: 2651/3: kernel helpers for NPTL support
    
    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    This patch entirely reworks the kernel assistance for NPTL on ARM.
    In particular this provides an efficient way to retrieve the TLS
    value and perform atomic operations without any instruction emulation
    nor special system call.  This even allows for pre ARMv6 binaries to
    be forward compatible with SMP systems without any penalty.
    The problematic and performance critical operations are performed
    through segment of kernel provided user code reachable from user space
    at a fixed address in kernel memory.  Those fixed entry points are
    within the vector page so we basically get it for free as no extra
    memory page is required and nothing else may be mapped at that
    location anyway.
    This is different from (but doesn't preclude) a full blown VDSO
    implementation, however a VDSO would prevent some assembly tricks with
    constants that allows for efficient branching to those code segments.
    And since those code segments only use a few cycles before returning to
    user code, the overhead of a VDSO far call would add a significant
    overhead to such minimalistic operations.
    The ARM_NR_set_tls syscall also changed number.  This is done for two
    reasons:
    1) this patch changes the way the TLS value was previously meant to be
       retrieved, therefore we ensure whatever library using the old way
       gets fixed (they only exist in private tree at the moment since the
       NPTL work is still progressing).
    2) the previous number was allocated in a range causing an undefined
       instruction trap on kernels not supporting that syscall and it was
       determined that allocating it in a range returning -ENOSYS would be
       much nicer for libraries trying to determine if the feature is
       present or not.

    Assigning the address zero to a PCI device BAR causes some part of the

    device fail.  Work around this by assigning I/O addresses starting
    from 00010000.
    While we're at it, make the PCI I/O resource end at 0001ffff, since we
    only have 64k of outbound I/O window on the IXP2000, and we don't do
    bank switching.

    calls set up via fsys_bubble_down, as well as ensuring that
    audit_syscall_exit() is called on return from sigreturn.
    
    Neglecting to check for TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT at these points results in
    incorrect information in audit_context, causing frequent system panics
    when system call auditing is enabled on an ia64 system.

    [AUDIT] Fix signedness of 'serial' in various routines.
    
    Attached is a patch that corrects a signed/unsigned warning. I also noticed
    that we needlessly init serial to 0. That only needs to occur if the kernel
    was compiled without the audit system.

    [AUDIT] Don't allow ptrace to fool auditing, log arch of audited syscalls.
    
    We were calling ptrace_notify() after auditing the syscall and arguments,
    but the debugger could have _changed_ them before the syscall was actually
    invoked. Reorder the calls to fix that.
    
    While we're touching ever call to audit_syscall_entry(), we also make it
    take an extra argument: the architecture of the syscall which was made,
    because some architectures allow more than one type of syscall.
    
    Also add an explicit success/failure flag to audit_syscall_exit(), for
    the benefit of architectures which return that in a condition register
    rather than only returning a single register.
    
    Change type of syscall return value to 'long' not 'int'.

    namei: add audit_inode to all branches in path_lookup
    
    Main change is in path_lookup: added a goto to do audit_inode
    instead of return statement, when emul_lookup_dentry for root
    is successful.The existing code does audit_inode only when
    lookup is done in normal root or cwd.
    
    Other changes: Some lookup routines are returning zero on success,
    and some are returning zero on failure. I documented the related
    function signatures in this code path, so that one can glance over
    abstract functions without understanding the entire code.

    AUDIT: Avoid log pollution by untrusted strings.
    
    We log strings from userspace, such as arguments to open(). These could
    be formatted to contain \n followed by fake audit log entries. Provide
    a function for logging such strings, which gives a hex dump when the
    string contains anything but basic printable ASCII characters. Use it
    for logging filenames.

    [PATCH] Add suspend method to cpufreq core
    
    In order to properly fix some issues with cpufreq vs. sleep on
    PowerBooks, I had to add a suspend callback to the pmac_cpufreq driver.
    I must force a switch to full speed before sleep and I switch back to
    previous speed on resume.
    
    I also added a driver flag to disable the warnings in suspend/resume
    since it is expected in this case to have different speed (and I want it
    to fixup the jiffies properly).

    [PATCH] time interpolator: Fix settimeofday inaccuracy
    
    settimeofday will set the time a little bit too early on systems using
    time interpolation since it subtracts the current interpolator offset
    from the time. This used to be necessary with the code in 2.6.9 and earlier
    but the new code resets the time interpolator after setting the time.
    Thus the time is set too early and gettimeofday will return a time slightly
    before the time specified with settimeofday if invoked immeditely after
    settimeofday.
    
    This removes the obsolete subtraction of the time interpolator offset
    and makes settimeofday set the time accurately.

    we're actually supporting 32bpp and not 24bpp.
    
    Also, add a check to ensure that we don't exceed the available
    framebuffer when changing display resolutions.

    Patch from Deepak Saxena
    
    The current memset() and memzero() macros on ARM reference the
    incoming parameters more than once and this can cause uninted
    side-effects. The issue was found while debugging SCTP protocol
    and with the specific usage of memzero(skb_put(skb,size),size).
    This call would call skb_put(skb,size) twice leading to badness.
    The fixed version copies the incoming parameters into local
    variables and uses those instead.

    [TG3]: Fix tg3_restart_ints()
    
    tg3_restart_ints() is called to re-enable interrupts after tg3_poll()
    has finished all the work. It calls tg3_cond_int() to force an interrupt
    if the status block updated bit is set. The updated bit will be set if
    there is a new status block update sometime during tg3_poll() and it can
    be very often. The worst part is that even if all the work has been
    processed, the updated bit remains set and an interrupt will be forced
    unnecessarily.
    
    The fix is to call tg3_has_work() instead to determine if new work is
    posted before forcing an interrupt. The way to force an interrupt is
    also changed to use "coalesce_now" instead of "SETINT". The former is
    generally a safer way to force the interrupt.
    
    Also deleted the first parameter to tg3_has_work() which is unused.

    [TG3]: Fix bug in tg3_rx()
    
    This patch fixes a bug that causes tg3_has_work() to always return 1.
    
    rx work is determined by comparing tp->rx_rcb_ptr with the current hw
    producer index. The hw producer index is modulo the ring size, but tp-
    >rx_rcb_ptr is a free running counter that goes up beyond the ring size.
    After the ring wraps around once, tg3_has_work() will always return 1.
    
    The fix is to always do modulo arithmetic on tp->rx_rcb_ptr.

    [IA64] fix ia64 Kconfig to allow CONFIG_PM on sn2
    
    This probably should have been fixed when I fixed up the generic build for
    discontig+numa machines, but oh well.
    
    CONFIG_PM is allowable for generic builds but not for sn2 builds, which
    doesn't make much sense, and in fact breaks the build if recent ACPI bits are
    added to the tree.  It looks like the only arch that needs to prevent
    CONFIG_PM stuff is the ski simulator (though those options could probably use
    some cleanup as well), so remove the big conditional and replace it with a
    simple test for IA64_HP_SIM instead.

    Current ia64 linux cannot handle greater than 184 interrupt sources

    to handle greater than 184 interrupt sources by allowing the same
    vector number to be shared by multiple IOSAPIC's RTEs. The design of
    this patch is besed on "Intel(R) Itanium(R) Processor Family Interrupt
    Architecture Guide".
    
    Even if you don't have a large I/O system, you can see the behavior of

    [IA64] fix syscall-optimization goof

      [IA64] Improve ia64_leave_syscall() for McKinley-type cores.
    
      Optimize ia64_leave_syscall() a bit better for McKinley-type cores.
      The patch looks big, but that's mostly due to renaming r16/r17 to r2/r3.
      Good for a 13 cycle improvement.
    
    The problem is that the size of the physical stacked registers was
    loaded into the wrong register (r3 instead of r17).  Since r17 by
    coincidence always had the value 1, this had the effect of turning
    rse_clear_invalid into a no-op.  That poses the risk of leaking kernel
    state back to user-land and is hence not acceptable.
    
    The fix below is simple, but unfortunately it costs us about 28 cycles
    in syscall overhead. ;-(
    
    Unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about that since those
    registers have to be cleared one way or another.

    [IA64] sba_iommu bug fixes
    
       This fixes a couple of bugs in the zx1/sx1000 sba_iommu.  These are
    all pretty low likelihood of hitting.  The first problem is a simple off
    by one, deep in the sba_alloc_range() error path.  Surrounding that was
    a lock ordering problem that could have potentially deadlocked with the
    order the locks are grabbed in sba_unmap_single().  I moved the resource
    locking into sba_search_bitmap() to prevent this.  Finally, there's a
    potential race between unmapping pdir entries and marking incoming DMA
    pages clean.  If you see any oddities, please let me know, but I've
    tested it pretty thoroughly here.  Tony, please apply.  Thanks,
    
    BTW, many of the options in this driver not on by default are becoming
    more and more broken.  I'll be working on some patches to clean them
    out, but I wanted to get this bug fix out first.

    [IA64] Percpu quicklist for combined allocator for pgd/pmd/pte.
    
    This patch introduces using the quicklists for pgd, pmd, and pte levels
    by combining the alloc and free functions into a common set of routines.
    This greatly simplifies the reading of this header file.
    
    This patch is simple but necessary for large numa configurations.
    It simply ensures that only pages from the local node are added to a
    cpus quicklist.  This prevents the trapping of pages on a remote nodes
    quicklist by starting a process, touching a large number of pages to
    fill pmd and pte entries, migrating to another node, and then unmapping
    or exiting.  With those conditions, the pages get trapped and if the
    machine has more than 100 nodes of the same size, the calculation of
    the pgtable high water mark will be larger than any single node so page
    table cache flushing will never occur.
    
    I ran lmbench lat_proc fork and lat_proc exec on a zx1 with and without
    this patch and did not notice any change.
    
    On an sn2 machine, there was a slight improvement which is possibly
    due to pages from other nodes trapped on the test node before starting
    the run.  I did not investigate further.
    
    This patch shrinks the quicklist based upon free memory on the node
    instead of the high/low water marks.  I have written it to enable
    preemption periodically and recalculate the amount to shrink every time
    we have freed enough pages that the quicklist size should have grown.
    I rescan the nodes zones each pass because other processess may be
    draining node memory at the same time as we are adding.

    [IA64-SGI] Altix: enable poweroff
    
    This patch adds the necessary "hook" to allow SGI/SN
    machines to perform a system power off upon a
    'init 0', 'halt -p', 'poweroff' or 'shutdown -h'.
    
    The "hook" is to set the pm_power_off callback
    to ia64_sn_power_down(). pm_power_off is checked
    in machine_power_off()/do_poweroff() and, if set, is executed.
    ia64_sn_power_down() is a function already present (but not
    used currently) in the sn kernel.
    ia64_sn_power_down() makes a SAL call to execute the
    power off.

    In the event a raw socket is created for sending purposes only, the creator

    add skbs to its queue until it fills up.
    
    Unfortunately, if ip_conntrack is loaded on the box, each skb we add to the
    queue potentially holds a reference to a conntrack.  If the user attempts
    to unload ip_conntrack, we will spin around forever since the queued skbs
    are pinned.

    [SPARC]: dump_stack for sparc
    
    Bob Breuer wrote a patch to add dump_stack for sparc. Supposedly, this
    was applied, but it doesn't exist in 2.6.11.
    
    This is the same patch, rediffed against 2.6.11.

    [SPARC]: Fix mxcc warning
    
    Peter Jones uncovered this one while we were debugging the framebuffer
    issues. There are some references to -1 in the mxcc asm code, which
    should be 0xffffffff.
    
    This patch gets rid of the -1s.

    [SPARC]: More sparc32 ksyms cleanups
    
    The sparc32 ksyms is missing a few more symbols, these are primarily
    related to SMP, and will be needed as SMP gets beaten back into
    functionality.
    
    Specifically, add __cpu_data (PER_CPU), cpu_online_map, and
    phys_cpu_present_map.
    
    This patch assumes that the earlier "linux-2.6.11-sparc-fixksyms.patch"
    is applied, otherwise, it will apply with fuzz.

    [SPARC]: TCX Framebuffer fixes
    
    Using the same logic as the other framebuffer fixes committed in 2.6.11,
    this is a set of fixes to make TCX functional on the console again. Adds
    the tcx_pan_display function, sets the
    all->info.var.{red,green,blue}.length values to 8, and runs fb_set_cmap.
    Also looks for the correct SUNW,tcx prom value.
    
    This patch just slipped through the cracks.

    [PKT_SCHED]: improve hashing performance of cls_fw
    
    Calculate hashtable size to fit into a page instead of a hardcoded
    256 buckets hash table. Results in a 1024 buckets hashtable on
    most systems.
    
    Replace old naive extract-8-lsb-bits algorithm with a better
    algorithm xor'ing 3 or 4 bit fields at the size of the hashtable
    array index in order to improve distribution if the majority of
    the lower bits are unused while keeping zero collision behaviour
    for the most common use case.
    
    Thanks to Wang Jian <lark@linux.net.cn> for bringing this issue
    to attention and to Eran Mann <emann@mrv.com> for the initial
    idea for this new algorithm.

    [SELINUX]: Fix ipv6_skip_exthdr() invocation causing OOPS.
    
    The SELinux hooks invoke ipv6_skip_exthdr() with an incorrect
    length final argument.  However, the length argument turns out
    to be superfluous.
    
    I was just reading ipv6_skip_exthdr and it occured to me that we can
    get rid of len altogether.  The only place where len is used is to
    check whether the skb has two bytes for ipv6_opt_hdr.  This check
    is done by skb_header_pointer/skb_copy_bits anyway.
    
    Now it might appear that we've made the code slower by deferring
    the check to skb_copy_bits.  However, this check should not trigger
    in the common case so this is OK.

    [TCP]: skb pcount with MTU discovery
    
    The problem is that when doing MTU discovery, the too-large segments in
    the write queue will be calculated as having a pcount of >1.  When
    tcp_write_xmit() is trying to send, tcp_snd_test() fails the cwnd test
    when pcount > cwnd.
    
    The segments are eventually transmitted one at a time by keepalive, but
    this can take a long time.
    
    This patch checks if TSO is enabled when setting pcount.

    [NETFILTER]: Fix NAT sequence number adjustment
    
    The NAT changes in 2.6.11 changed the position where helpers
    are called and perform packet mangling. Before 2.6.11, a NAT
    helper was called before the packet was NATed and had its
    sequence number adjusted. Since 2.6.11, the helpers get packets
    with already adjusted sequence numbers.
    
    This breaks sequence number adjustment, adjust_tcp_sequence()
    needs the original sequence number to determine whether
    a packet was a retransmission and to store it for further
    corrections. It can't be reconstructed without more information
    than available, so this patch restores the old order by
    calling helpers from a new conntrack hook two priorities
    below ip_conntrack_confirm() and adjusting the sequence number
    from a new NAT hook one priority below ip_conntrack_confirm().

    [PATCH] USB: Fix for ati_remote
    
    when stealing code from ati_remote for a GPL-driver of my usbradio (because of
    its neat usb int transfers) I found out, that the inbuf is freed twice.
    
    I don't have the ati-remote, so I don't know it is a problem at all, but it
    looks strange to me anyway. Also I don't know if it has been fixed already in
    newer kernel versions.

    [PATCH] USB: better usbnet zaurus/mdlm/... fix
    
    This is a somewhat more comprehensive fix for the problem of devices
    like the newer Zaurii ... or in this case some Motorola cell phones.
    
    To recap, the problem's root cause is that these devices aren't using
    standard USB class specifications for their network links, and so far
    we've had to add lots of device-specific driver entries.  The vendor
    fix abuses the CDC MDLM descriptors (they _could_ have conformed to
    the spec, but didn't) and defines a "Belcarra firmware" pseudo-class.
    
    This patch recognizes that pseudo-class by the GUIDs in those descriptors,
    and handles the devices that just use the Zaurus framing.

    [PATCH] USB: scripts/mod/file2alias.c: handle numeric ranges for USB bcdDevice
    
    Another attempt at that...
    
    The attached patch fixes the longstanding problem with USB bcdDevice
    numeric ranges incorrectly converted into patterns for MODULE_ALIAS
    generation.  Previously it put both the lower and the upper limits into
    the pattern, dlXdhY, making it impossible to fnmatch against except for
    a few special cases, like dl*dh* or dlXdhX.
    
    The patch makes it generate multiple MODULE_ALIAS lines covering the
    whole range with fnmatch-able patterns.  E.g. for a range between 0x0001
    and 0x8345 it gives the following patterns:
    
    000[1-9]
    00[1-9]*
    0[1-9]*
    [1-7]*
    8[0-2]*
    83[0-3]*
    834[0-5]
    
    Since bcdDevice is 2 bytes wide = 4 digits in hex representation, the
    max no. of patters is 2 * 4 - 1 = 7.
    
    The values are BCD (binary-coded decimals) and not hex, so patterns
    using a dash seem to be safe regardless of locale collation order.
    
    The patch changes bcdDevice part of the alias from dlXdhY to dZ, but
    this shouldn't have big compatibility issues because fnmatch()-based
    modprobing hasn't yet been widely used.  Besides, the most common (and
    almost the only working) case of dl*dh* becomes d* and thus continues to
    work.
    
    The patch is against 2.6.12-rc2, applies to -mm3 with an offset.  The
    matching patch to fix the MODALIAS environment variable now generated by
    the usb hotplug function follows.

    I was not removing 1203, it's just the extension of the bcd range. You are
    right about 1205, as I wrote, it was a patch against 2.6.11.7. Attached is
    a patch against 2.6.12-rc2.

    I just copied from other entries. There're a lot 0xffffs in unusual_dev.h,
    so I assumed it is correct. I changed it to 0x9999.
    
    > 3. It's rather obnoxious to take the original submitter's credit away.
    
    I didn't remove it, I changed it to "based on...". Because I changed
    something (the range) in his entry, I thought it is the best to take the
    responsibility but keep the origin. Anyway, in the new patch I did it in a
    different way.

    I don't have an old iPod mini, but you find a lot of evidence here:

    Especially this one:

    No, the patch was ok, but I agree it looks strange. It's not very
    readable, because I cannot tell diff to work blockwise instead of
    linewise. Because of the similarity of the entries, diff splits and merges
    them. Anyway, the new patch "looks" better. ;-)

    [IA64] cpu hotplug: return offlined cpus to SAL
    
    This patch is required to support cpu removal for IPF systems. Existing code
    just fakes the real offline by keeping it run the idle thread, and polling
    for the bit to re-appear in the cpu_state to get out of the idle loop.
    
    For the cpu-offline to work correctly, we need to pass control of this CPU
    back to SAL so it can continue in the boot-rendez mode. This gives the
    SAL control to not pick this cpu as the monarch processor for global MCA
    events, and addition does not wait for this cpu to checkin with SAL
    for global MCA events as well. The handoff is implemented as documented in
    SAL specification section 3.2.5.1 "OS_BOOT_RENDEZ to SAL return State"

    [TG3]: Split tg3_phy_probe into 2 functions
    
    Split the 1st half of tg3_phy_probe() into tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg() so
    that the TG3_FLAG_EEPROM_WRITE_PROT can be determined before calling
    tg3_set_power_state() in tg3_get_invariants(). This will allow
    tg3_set_power_state() to drive the GPIOs correctly based on the config.
    information in eeprom.
    
    On the 5752, there are no pull-up resistors on the GPIO pins and it is
    necessary to drive the unused GPIOs as output.

    [IA64] fix fls()
    
    The ia64-version of fls() never worked as intended (the bitnumbering
    was off by 1 and fls(0) was undefined).  This patch fixes the problem
    by using a popcnt-based fls(), which on McKinley-derived cores is
    slightly faster than both ia64_fls() and generic_fls().  The resulting
    code, however, is bigger (7-8 bundles instead of about 3 bundles).
    Also switch ia64_popcnt() to __builtin_popcountl() for GCC v3.4 or
    newer since the compiler can predicate that and schedule it better.

    While looking at this problem I noticed that IPv6 was sometimes
    looking at inet->recverr which is bogus.  Here is a patch to

    at PAGE_SIZE throughout the architecture.

    [PATCH] freepgt: free_pgtables from FIRST_USER_ADDRESS
    
    The patches to free_pgtables by vma left problems on any architectures which
    leave some user address page table entries unencapsulated by vma.  Andi has
    fixed the 32-bit vDSO on x86_64 to use a vma.  Now fix arm (and arm26), whose
    first PAGE_SIZE is reserved (perhaps) for machine vectors.
    
    Our calls to free_pgtables must not touch that area, and exit_mmap's
    BUG_ON(nr_ptes) must allow that arm's get_pgd_slow may (or may not) have
    allocated an extra page table, which its free_pgd_slow would free later.
    
    FIRST_USER_PGD_NR has misled me and others: until all the arches define
    FIRST_USER_ADDRESS instead, a hack in mmap.c to derive one from t'other.  This
    patch fixes the bugs, the remaining patches just clean it up.

    are never presented, and the arch variants can go.

    [PATCH] freepgt: hugetlb_free_pgd_range
    
    ia64 and ppc64 had hugetlb_free_pgtables functions which were no longer being
    called, and it wasn't obvious what to do about them.
    
    The ppc64 case turns out to be easy: the associated tables are noted elsewhere
    and freed later, safe to either skip its hugetlb areas or go through the
    motions of freeing nothing.  Since ia64 does need a special case, restore to
    ppc64 the special case of skipping them.
    
    The ia64 hugetlb case has been broken since pgd_addr_end went in, though it
    probably appeared to work okay if you just had one such area; in fact it's
    been broken much longer if you consider a long munmap spanning from another
    region into the hugetlb region.
    
    In the ia64 hugetlb region, more virtual address bits are available than in
    the other regions, yet the page tables are structured the same way: the page
    at the bottom is larger.  Here we need to scale down each addr before passing
    it to the standard free_pgd_range.  Was about to write a hugely_scaled_down
    macro, but found htlbpage_to_page already exists for just this purpose.  Fixed
    off-by-one in ia64 is_hugepage_only_range.
    
    Uninline free_pgd_range to make it available to ia64.  Make sure the
    vma-gathering loop in free_pgtables cannot join a hugepage_only_range to any
    other (safe to join huges?  probably but don't bother).

    [PATCH] freepgt: remove MM_VM_SIZE(mm)
    
    There's only one usage of MM_VM_SIZE(mm) left, and it's a troublesome macro
    because mm doesn't contain the (32-bit emulation?) info needed.  But it too is
    only needed because we ignore the end from the vma list.
    
    We could make flush_pgtables return that end, or unmap_vmas.  Choose the
    latter, since it's a natural fit with unmap_mapping_range_vma needing to know
    its restart addr.  This does make more than minimal change, but if unmap_vmas
    had returned the end before, this is how we'd have done it, rather than
    storing the break_addr in zap_details.
    
    unmap_vmas used to return count of vmas scanned, but that's just debug which
    hasn't been useful in a while; and if we want the map_count 0 on exit check
    back, it can easily come from the final remove_vm_struct loop.

    [PATCH] freepgt: free_pgtables use vma list
    
    Recent woes with some arches needing their own pgd_addr_end macro; and 4-level
    clear_page_range regression since 2.6.10's clear_page_tables; and its
    long-standing well-known inefficiency in searching throughout the higher-level
    page tables for those few entries to clear and free: all can be blamed on
    ignoring the list of vmas when we free page tables.
    
    Replace exit_mmap's clear_page_range of the total user address space by
    free_pgtables operating on the mm's vma list; unmap_region use it in the same
    way, giving floor and ceiling beyond which it may not free tables.  This
    brings lmbench fork/exec/sh numbers back to 2.6.10 (unless preempt is enabled,
    in which case latency fixes spoil unmap_vmas throughput).
    
    Beware: the do_mmap_pgoff driver failure case must now use unmap_region
    instead of zap_page_range, since a page table might have been allocated, and
    can only be freed while it is touched by some vma.
    
    Move free_pgtables from mmap.c to memory.c, where its lower levels are adapted
    from the clear_page_range levels.  (Most of free_pgtables' old code was
    actually for a non-existent case, prev not properly set up, dating from before
    hch gave us split_vma.) Pass mmu_gather** in the public interfaces, since we
    might want to add latency lockdrops later; but no attempt to do so yet, going
    by vma should itself reduce latency.
    
    But what if is_hugepage_only_range?  Those ia64 and ppc64 cases need careful
    examination: put that off until a later patch of the series.
    
    What of x86_64's 32bit vdso page __map_syscall32 maps outside any vma?
    
    And the range to sparc64's flush_tlb_pgtables?  It's less clear to me now that
    we need to do more than is done here - every PMD_SIZE ever occupied will be
    flushed, do we really have to flush every PGDIR_SIZE ever partially occupied?
    A shame to complicate it unnecessarily.

    [PATCH] debugfs: Reduce <linux/debugfs.h> dependencies
    
    The current <linux/debugfs.h> include file is a little fragile in that
    it is not self-contained and hence may cause compile warnings or
    errors depending on the files included before it, the kernel config
    and the architecture.  This patch makes things a little more robust by:
    
     - including <linux/types.h> to get definitions of u32, mode_t, and so on.
     - forward declaring struct file_operations.
     - including <linux/err.h> when CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is not set
    
    The last change is particularly useful, as a kernel developer is
    likely to build with debugfs always enabled and never see the build
    breakage cased if debugfs is disabled.

    [PATCH] export platform_add_devices
    
    platform_add_devices can be used from within modules, so it should be
    exported.  This can for example happen if you have hotpluggable firmware in
    an FPGA on a system on chip processor; in our case the FPGA is probed for
    devices and the FPGA base code registers the devices it has found with the
    kernel.
    
    (akpm: I think this is reasonable from a licensing POV: it's unlikely that
    anyone would be interested in merging such specialised modules into mainline,
    and it's a GPL export).

    Here we add a TIMEOUT value to the hotplug environment of the firmware
    requesting event. I will adapt udevd not to wait for anything else, if
    it finds a TIMEOUT key.

    [PATCH] I2C: Fix incorrect sysfs file permissions in it87 and via686a drivers
    
    The it87 and via686a hardware monitoring drivers each create a sysfs
    file named "alarms" in R/W mode, while they should really create it in
    read-only mode. Since we don't provide a store function for these files,
    write attempts to these files will do something undefined (I guess) and
    bad (I am sure). My own try resulted in a locked terminal (where I
    attempted the write) and a 100% CPU load until next reboot.
    
    As a side note, wouldn't it make sense to check, when creating sysfs
    files, that readable files have a non-NULL show method, and writable
    files have a non-NULL store method? I know drivers are not supposed to
    do stupid things, but there is already a BUG_ON for several conditions
    in sysfs_create_file, so maybe we could add two more?

    Here comes a small cleanup patch for the via686a driver. I noticed the
    following two non-fatal problems:
    
    1* The device parent is explicitely set, but it's not needed because the
    i2c core will do as the client is registered.
    
    2* snprintf is used where strlcpy would suffice.
    
    Fixing them brings the via686a driver in line with what other similar
    drivers do.

    [PATCH] usb gadget: ethernet/rndis updates
    
    Updates to the Ethernet/RNDIS gadget driver (mostly for RNDIS):
    
      - Fix brown-paper bag goof with RNDIS packet TX ... the wrong length
        field got set, so Windows would ignore data packets it received.
    
      - More consistent handling of CDC output filters (but not yet hooking
        things up so RNDIS uses the mechanism).
    
      - Zerocopy RX for RNDIS packets too (saving CPU cycles).
    
      - Use the pre-allocated interrupt/status request and buffer, rather
        than allocating and freeing one of each every few seconds (which
        could fail).
    
      - Some more "sparse" tweaks, making both dual-speed and single-speed
        configurations happier.
    
      - RNDIS speeds are reported in units of 100bps, not bps.
    
    Plus two minor cleanups (whitespace, messaging).

    [PATCH] USB: bug fix in usbdevfs
    
    I am sorry that the last patch about 32 bit compat ioctl on
    64 bit kernel actually breaks the usbdevfs. That is on the current
    BK tree. I am retarded.
    
    Here is the patch to fix it. Tested with USB hard disk and webcam
    in both 32bit compatible mode and native 64bit mode.
    
    Again, sorry about that.

    [PATCH] USB: revert "fix" to usb_set_interface()
    
    This reverts a recent change to usb_set_interface().  The change worked
    around a quirk in certain devices, but doing this in usbcore creates
    needless regressions for other devices.  More appropriate fixes won't
    put such handling in usbcore.
    
    Basically it's tricky to do a full software reset of USB device state, since
    the devices don't all act the same.  This adds a note to the kerneldoc for
    the usb_reset_configuration() call to highlight the quirk this was working
    around:  endpoint data toggles not being reset.

    [PATCH] USB: hcd suspend uses pm_message_t
    
    This patch includes minor "sparse -Wbitwise" updates for the PCI based
    HCDs.  Almost all of them involve just changing the second parameter of the
    suspend() method to a pm_message_t ...  the others relate to how the EHCI
    code walks in-memory data structures.  (There's a minor bug fixed there too
    ...  affecting the big-endian sysfs async schedule dump.)

    [PATCH] usb suspend updates (interface suspend)
    
    This is the first of a few installments of PM API updates to match the
    recent switch to "pm_message_t".  This installment primarily affects
    USB device drivers (for USB interfaces), and it changes the handful of
    drivers which currently implement suspend methods:
    
        - <linux/usb.h> and usbcore, signature change
    
        - Some drivers only changed the signature, net effect this just
          shuts up "sparse -Wbitwise":
    	* hid-core
    	* stir4200
    
        - Two network drivers did that, and also grew slightly more
          featureful suspend code ... they now properly shut down
          their activities.  (As should stir4200...)
    	* pegasus
    	* usbnet
    
    Note that the Wake-On-Lan (WOL) support in pegasus doesn't yet work; looks
    to me like it's missing a request to turn it on, vs just configuring it.
    The ASIX code in usbnet also has WOL hooks that are ready to use; untested.

    [PATCH] usb resume fixes
    
    This has a variety of updates to the shared suspend/resume code for
    PCI based USB host controllers.
    
        - Cope with pm_message_t replacing the target system state.
          This is actually a loss of functionality; PCI D1 and D2
          states will no longer be used, and it's no longer knowable
          that D3cold is on the way so power will be lost.
    
        - Most importantly, some of the resume paths are reworked and
          cleaned up.  They're now an exact mirror of suspend paths,
          and more care is taken to ensure the hardware is reactivated
          before the hardware re-enables interrupts.
    
    Plus comment and diagnostic cleanups; there are some nasty cases here
    especially combined with swsusp, now they're somewhat commented.

      values on the mappings.
    
      Make the check for space in the ring buffer happen after the DMA mapping
      is done since any checks done before the mapping has taken place are

    This adds 32-bit compatibility for mounting an NFSv4 mount on a 64-bit
    kernel (such as happens with PPC64).
    
    The problem is that the mount data for the NFS4 mount process includes
    auxilliary data pointers, probably because the NFS4 mount data may
    conceivably exceed PAGE_SIZE in size - thus breaking against the hard
    limit imposed by sys_mount().

    [PATCH] SELinux: fix deadlock on dcache lock
    
    This fixes a deadlock on the dcache lock detected during testing at IBM
    by moving the logging of the current executable information from the
    SELinux avc_audit function to audit_log_exit (via an audit_log_task_info
    helper) for processing upon syscall exit.
    
    For consistency, the patch also removes the logging of other
    task-related information from avc_audit, deferring handling to
    audit_log_exit instead.
    
    This allows simplification of the avc_audit code, allows the exe
    information to be obtained more reliably, always includes the comm
    information (useful for scripts), and avoids including bogus task
    information for checks performed from irq or softirq.

    [PATCH] sparc64: Reduce ptrace cache flushing
    
    We were flushing the D-cache excessively for ptrace() processing
    and this makes debugging threads so slow as to be totally unusable.
    
    All process page accesses via ptrace() go via access_process_vm().
    This routine, for each process page, uses get_user_pages().  That
    in turn does a flush_dcache_page() on the child pages before we
    copy in/out the ptrace request data.
    
    Therefore, all we need to do after the data movement is:
    
    1) Flush the D-cache pages if the kernel maps the page to a different
       color than userspace does.
    2) If we wrote to the page, we need to flush the I-cache on older cpus.
    
    Previously we just flushed the entire cache at the end of a ptrace()
    request, and that was beyond stupid.

    [PATCH] sparc: Fix PTRACE_CONT bogosity
    
    SunOS aparently had this weird PTRACE_CONT semantic which
    we copied.  If the addr argument is something other than
    1, it sets the process program counter to whatever that
    value is.
    
    This is different from every other Linux architecture, which
    don't do anything with the addr and data args.
    
    This difference in particular breaks the Linux native GDB support
    for fork and vfork tracing on sparc and sparc64.
    
    There is no interest in running SunOS binaries using this weird
    PTRACE_CONT behavior, so just delete it so we behave like other
    platforms do.

    This case actually can get exercised a lot during an ELF

    all of these spurious cache flushes on sparc64.

    [PATCH] revert fs/char_dev.c CONFIG_BASE_FULL change
    
    This reverts a fs/char_dev.c patch that was merged into BK on March 3.
    
    The problem is that it breaks things ... __register_chrdev_region() has
    a block of code, commented "temporary" for over two years now, which
    fails rudely during PCMCIA initialization or other register_chrdev()
    calls, because it doesn't "degrade to linked list".  This keeps whole
    subsystems from working.
    
    A real fix to that "temporary" code should be possible, using some better
    scheme to allocate major numbers, but it's not something I want to spend
    time on just now.

    [PATCH] sg.c: update
    
    The attachment combines the most recent patch from
    Yum Rayan <yum.rayan@gmail.com> (to reduce sg stack
    usage), Adrian Bunk <bunk@stusta.de> (to fix check
    after use) and me (fix elapsed time calculation
    (duration) on ia64 machines).
    
    I have modified the patch from Yum Rayan so kmalloc()
    in sg_read() is only called for the (rare) code paths
    that need them.
    
    Changelog:
       - reduce stack usage in sg_ioctl() and sg_read()
       - fix check after use in sg_mmap()
       - hold duration internally in milliseconds and
         check current time later than held time

    There is a tiny race when de-registering an MD thread, in that the thread

    This is most easily closed by holding tasklist_lock between enabling the

    [PATCH] jbd dirty buffer leak fix
    
    This fixes the lots-of-fsx-linux-instances-cause-a-slow-leak bug.
    
    It's been there since 2.6.6, caused by:
    
    ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.5/2.6.5-mm4/broken-out/jbd-move-locked-buffers.patch
    
    That patch moves under-writeout ordered-data buffers onto a separate journal
    list during commit.  It took out the old code which was based on a single
    list.
    
    The old code (necessarily) had logic which would restart I/O against buffers
    which had been redirtied while they were on the committing transaction's
    t_sync_datalist list.  The new code only writes buffers once, ignoring
    redirtyings by a later transaction, which is good.
    
    But over on the truncate side of things, in journal_unmap_buffer(), we're
    treating buffers on the t_locked_list as inviolable things which belong to the
    committing transaction, and we just leave them alone during concurrent
    truncate-vs-commit.
    
    The net effect is that when truncate tries to invalidate a page whose buffers
    are on t_locked_list and have been redirtied, journal_unmap_buffer() just
    leaves those buffers alone.  truncate will remove the page from its mapping
    and we end up with an anonymous clean page with dirty buffers, which is an
    illegal state for a page.  The JBD commit will not clean those buffers as they
    are removed from t_locked_list.  The VM (try_to_free_buffers) cannot reclaim
    these pages.
    
    The patch teaches journal_unmap_buffer() about buffers which are on the
    committing transaction's t_locked_list.  These buffers have been written and
    I/O has completed.  We can take them off the transaction and undirty them
    within the context of journal_invalidatepage()->journal_unmap_buffer().

    [PATCH] IB/mthca: add fast memory region implementation
    
    Implement fast memory regions (FMRs), where the driver writes directly into
    the HCA's translation tables rather than requiring a firmware command.  For
    Tavor, MTTs for FMR are separate from regular MTTs, and are reserved at driver
    initialization.  This is done to limit the amount of virtual memory needed to
    map the MTTs.  For Arbel, there's no such limitation, and all MTTs and MPTs
    may be used for FMR or for regular MR.

    [PATCH] IB/mthca: fix MTT allocation in mem-free mode
    
    Fix bug in MTT allocation in mem-free mode.
    
    I misunderstood the MTT size value returned by the firmware -- it is really
    the size of a single MTT entry, since mem-free mode does not segment the MTT
    as the original firmware did.  This meant that our MTT addresses ended up
    being off by a factor of 8.  This meant that our MTT allocations might
    overlap, and so we could overwrite and corrupt earlier memory regions when
    writing new MTT entries.
    
    We fix this by always using our 64-byte MTT segment size.  This allows some
    simplification of the code as well, since there's no reason to put the MTT
    segment size in a variable -- we can always use our enum value directly.

    Doorbell record pages are allocated in HCA page size chunks (always 4096

    Correct and simplify calculation of static rate.  We need to round up the

    [PATCH] pci enumeration on ixp2000: overflow in kernel/resource.c
    
    IXP2000 (ARM-based) platforms use a separate 'struct resource' for PCI MEM
    space.  Resource allocation for PCI BARs always fails because the 'root'
    resource (the IXP2000 PCI MEM resource) always has the entire address space
    (00000000-ffffffff) free, and find_resource() calculates the size of that
    range as ffffffff-00000000+1=0, so all allocations fail because it thinks
    there is no space.

    [PATCH] add Big Endian variants of ioread/iowrite
    
    In the new io infrastructure, all of our operators are expecting the
    underlying device to be little endian (because the PCI bus, their main
    consumer, is LE).
    
    However, there are a fair few devices and busses in the world that are
    actually Big Endian.  There's even evidence that some of these BE bus and
    chip types are attached to LE systems.  Thus, there's a need for a BE
    equivalent of our io{read,write}{16,32} operations.
    
    The attached patch adds this as io{read,write}{16,32}be.  When it's in,
    I'll add the first consume (the 53c700 SCSI chip driver).

    [PATCH] Direct IO async short read fix
    
    The direct I/O code is mapping the read request to the file system block.  If
    the file size was not on a block boundary, the result would show the the read
    reading past EOF.  This was only happening for the AIO case.  The non-AIO case
    truncates the result to match file size (in direct_io_worker).  This patch
    does the same thing for the AIO case, it truncates the result to match the
    file size if the read reads past EOF.
    
    When I/O completes the result can be truncated to match the file size
    without using i_size_read(), thus the aio result now matches the number of
    bytes read to the end of file.

    [PATCH] ext2 corruption - regression between 2.6.9 and 2.6.10
    
    Whilst trying to stress test a Promise SX8 card, we stumbled across
    some nasty filesystem corruption in ext2. Our tests involved
    creating an ext2 partition, mounting, running several concurrent
    fsx's over it, umounting, and fsck'ing, all scripted[1]. The fsck
    would always return with errors.
    
    This regression was traced back to a change between 2.6.9 and
    2.6.10, which moves the functionality of ext2_put_inode into
    ext2_clear_inode.  The attached patch reverses this change, and
    eliminated the source of corruption.
    
    Mingming Cao <cmm@us.ibm.com> said:
    
    I think his patch for ext2 is correct.  The corruption on ext3 is not the same
    issue he saw on ext2.  I believe that's the race between discard reservation
    and reservation in-use that we already fixed it in 2.6.12- rc1.
    
    For the problem related to ext2, at the time when we design reservation for
    ext3, we decide we only need to discard the reservation at the last file
    close, so we have ext3_discard_reservation on iput_final- >ext3_clear_inode.
    
    The ext2 handle discard preallocation differently at that time, it discard the
    preallocation at each iput(), not in input_final(), so we think it's
    unnecessary to thrash it so frequently, and the right thing to do, as we did
    for ext3 reservation, discard preallocation on last iput().  So we moved the
    ext2_discard_preallocation from ext2_put_inode(0 to ext2_clear_inode.
    
    Since ext2 preallocation is doing pre-allocation on disk, so it is possible
    that at the unmount time, someone is still hold the reference of the inode, so
    the preallocation for a file is not discard yet, so we still mark those blocks
    allocated on disk, while they are not actually in the inode's block map, so
    fsck will catch/fix that error later.
    
    This is not a issue for ext3, as ext3 reservation(pre-allocation) is done in
    memory.

    [PATCH] kernel/param.c: don't use .max when .num is NULL in param_array_set()
    
    there seems to be a bug, at least for me, in kernel/param.c for arrays with
    .num == NULL.  If .num == NULL, the function param_array_set() uses &.max
    for the call to param_array(), wich alters the .max value to the number of
    arguments.  The result is, you can't set more array arguments as the last
    time you set the parameter.
    
    example:
    
    # a module 'example' with
    # static int array[10] = { 0, };
    # module_param_array(array, int, NULL, 0644);
    
    $ insmod example.ko array=1,2,3
    $ cat /sys/module/example/parameters/array
    1,2,3
    $ echo "4,3,2,1" > /sys/module/example/parameters/array
    $ dmesg | tail -n 1
    kernel: array: can take only 3 arguments

    [PATCH] AYSNC IO using singals other than SIGIO
    
    A question on sigwaitinfo based IO mechanism in multithreaded applications.
    
    I am trying to use RT signals to notify me of IO events using RT signals
    instead of SIGIO in a multithreaded applications.  I noticed that there was
    some discussion on lkml during november 1999 with the subject of the
    discussion as "Signal driven IO".  In the thread I noticed that RT signals
    were being delivered to the worker thread.  I am running 2.6.10 kernel and
    I am trying to use the very same mechanism and I find that only SIGIO being
    propogated to the worker threads and RT signals only being propogated to
    the main thread and not the worker threads where I actually want them to be
    propogated too.  On further inspection I found that the following patch
    which I have attached solves the problem.
    
    I am not sure if this is a bug or feature in the kernel.
    
    
    Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com> said:
    
    This relates only to fcntl F_SETSIG, which is a Linux extension.  So there is
    no POSIX issue.  When changing various things like the normal SIGIO signalling
    to do group signals, I was concerned strictly with the POSIX semantics and
    generally avoided touching things in the domain of Linux inventions.  That's
    why I didn't change this when I changed the call right next to it.  There is
    no reason I can see that F_SETSIG-requested signals shouldn't use a group
    signal like normal SIGIO does.  I'm happy to ACK this patch, there is nothing
    wrong with its change to the semantics in my book.  But neither POSIX nor I
    care a whit what F_SETSIG does.

    [PATCH] possible use-after-free of bio
    
    There is a possibility that a bio will be accessed after it has been freed
    on SCSI.  It happens if you submit a bio with BIO_SYNC marked and the
    auto-unplugging kicks the request_fn, SCSI re-enables interrupts in-between
    so if the request completes between the add_request() in __make_request()
    and the bio_sync() call, we could be looking at a dead bio.  It's a slim
    race, but it has been triggered in the Real World.
    
    So assign bio_sync() to a local variable instead.

    [PATCH] x86, x86_64: dual core proc-cpuinfo and sibling-map fix
    
    - broken sibling_map setup in x86_64
    
    - grouping all the core and HT related cpuinfo fields.
      We are reasonably sure that adding new cpuinfo fields after "siblings" field,
      will not cause any app failure. Thats because today's /proc/cpuinfo
      format is completely different on x86, x86_64 and we haven't heard of any
      x86 app breakage because of this issue. Grouping these fields will
      result in more or less common format on all architectures (ia64, x86 and
      x86_64) and will cause less confusion.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Switch SMP bootup over to new CPU hotplug state machine
    
    This will allow hotplug CPU in the future and in general cleans up a lot of
    crufty code.  It also should plug some races that the old hackish way
    introduces.  Remove one old race workaround in NMI watchdog setup that is not
    needed anymore.
    
    I removed the old total sum of bogomips reporting code.  The brag value of
    BogoMips has been greatly devalued in the last years on the open market.
    
    Real CPU hotplug will need some more work, but the infrastructure for it is
    there now.
    
    One drawback: the new TSC sync algorithm is less accurate than before.  The
    old way of zeroing TSCs is too intrusive to do later.  Instead the TSC of the
    BP is duplicated now, which is less accurate.
    
    akpm:
    
    - sync_tsc_bp_init seems to have the sense of `init' inverted.
    
    - SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED is deprecated - use DEFINE_SPINLOCK.

    Exceptions and hardware interrupts can, to a certain degree, nest, so when

    contents this has to be accounted for.  Also, IST stacks have their tops
    stored in the TSS, so there's no need to add the stack size to get to their
    ends.

    [PATCH] x86_64: add support for Intel dual-core detection and displaying
    
    Appended patch adds the support for Intel dual-core detection and displaying
    the core related information in /proc/cpuinfo.
    
    It adds two new fields "core id" and "cpu cores" to x86 /proc/cpuinfo and the
    "core id" field for x86_64("cpu cores" field is already present in x86_64).
    
    Number of processor cores in a die is detected using cpuid(4) and this is
    documented in IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual (vol 2a)
    (http://developer.intel.com/design/pentium4/manuals/index_new.htm#sdm_vol2a)
    
    This patch also adds cpu_core_map similar to cpu_sibling_map.
    
    Slightly hacked by AK.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Keep only a single debug notifier chain
    
    Calling a notifier three times in the debug handler does not make much sense,
    because a debugger can figure out the various conditions by itself.  Remove
    the additional calls to DIE_DEBUG and DIE_DEBUGSTEP completely.
    
    This matches what i386 does now.
    
    This also makes sure interrupts are always still disabled when calling a
    debugger, which prevents:
    
    BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000001] code: tpopf/1470
    caller is post_kprobe_handler+0x9/0x70
    
    Call Trace:<ffffffff8024f10f>{smp_processor_id+191} <ffffffff80120e69>{post_kpro
    be_handler+9}
    <ffffffff80120f7a>{kprobe_exceptions_notify+58}

    <ffffffff8010f513>{debug+127}  <EOE>
    
    on preemptible debug kernels with kprobes when single stepping in user space.
    
    This was probably a bug even on non preempt kernels, this function was
    supposed to be running with interrupts off according to a comment there.
    
    Note to third part debugger maintainers: please double check your debugger can
    still single step.

    [PATCH] x86_64: Regularize exception stack handling
    
    This fixes various issues in the return path for "paranoid"
    handlers (= running on a private exception stack that act like NMIs).
    
    Generalize previous hack to switch back to process stack for
    scheduling/signal handling purposes.

    [PATCH] x86_64 genapic update
    
    x86_64 genapic mechanism should be aware of machines that use physical APIC
    mode regardless of how many clusters/processors are detected.
    
    ACPI 3.0 FADT makes this determination very simple by providing a feature
    flag "force_apic_physical_destination_mode" to state whether the machine
    unconditionally uses physical APIC mode.
    
    Unisys' next generation x86_64 ES7000 will need to utilize this FADT
    feature flag in order to boot the x86_64 kernel in the correct APIC mode.
    This patch has been tested on both x86_64 commodity and ES7000 boxes.

    [PATCH] i386: Use loaddebug macro consistently
    
    This moves the macro loaddebug from asm-i386/suspend.h to
    asm-i386/processor.h, which is the place that makes sense for it to be
    defined, removes the extra copy of the same macro in
    arch/i386/kernel/process.c, and makes arch/i386/kernel/signal.c use the
    macro in place of its expansion.
    
    This is a purely cosmetic cleanup for the normal i386 kernel.  However, it
    is handy for Xen to be able to just redefine the loaddebug macro once
    instead of also changing the signal.c code.

    [PATCH] ppc64: no prefetch for NULL pointers
    
    For prefetches of NULL (as when walking a short linked list), PPC64 will in
    some cases take a performance hit.  The hardware needs to do the TLB walk,
    and said walk will always miss, which means (up to) two L2 misses as
    penalty.  This seems to hurt overall performance, so for NULL pointers skip
    the prefetch alltogether.

    [PATCH] ppc64: remove -fno-omit-frame-pointer
    
    During some code inspection using gcc 4.0 I noticed a stack frame was being
    created for a number of functions that didnt require it.  For example:
    
    c0000000000df944 <._spin_unlock>:
    c0000000000df944:       fb e1 ff f0     std     r31,-16(r1)
    c0000000000df948:       f8 21 ff c1     stdu    r1,-64(r1)
    c0000000000df94c:       7c 3f 0b 78     mr      r31,r1
    c0000000000df950:       7c 20 04 ac     lwsync
    c0000000000df954:       e8 21 00 00     ld      r1,0(r1)
    c0000000000df958:       38 00 00 00     li      r0,0
    c0000000000df95c:       90 03 00 00     stw     r0,0(r3)
    c0000000000df960:       eb e1 ff f0     ld      r31,-16(r1)
    c0000000000df964:       4e 80 00 20     blr
    
    It turns out we are adding -fno-omit-frame-pointer to ppc64 which is
    causing the above behaviour.  Removing that flag results in much better
    code:
    
    c0000000000d5b30 <._spin_unlock>:

    [PATCH] ppc64: remove bogus f50 hack in prom.c
    
    The code that parses the OF device tree contains an old bogus hack which
    was killed a long time ago on ppc32, but survived in ppc64.  It was
    supposed to help with a problem on the f50 which is ...  a 32 bits machine
    :) Additionally, that hack is causing problems, so let's just get rid of
    it.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Detect altivec via firmware on unknown CPUs
    
    This patch adds detection of the Altivec capability of the CPU via the
    firmware in addition to the cpu table.  This allows newer CPUs that aren't
    in the table to still have working altivec support in the kernel.
    
    It also fixes a problem where if a CPU isn't recognized as having altivec
    features, and takes an altivec unavailable exception due to userland
    issuing altivec instructions, the kernel would happily enable it and
    context switch the registers ...  but not all of them (it would basically
    forget vrsave).  With this patch, the kernel will refuse to enable altivec
    when the feature isn't detected for the CPU (SIGILL).

    [PATCH] ppc64: Improve mapping of vDSO
    
    This patch reworks the way the ppc64 is mapped in user memory by the kernel
    to make it more robust against possible collisions with executable
    segments.  Instead of just whacking a VMA at 1Mb, I now use
    get_unmapped_area() with a hint, and I moved the mapping of the vDSO to
    after the mapping of the various ELF segments and of the interpreter, so
    that conflicts get caught properly (it still has to be before
    create_elf_tables since the later will fill the AT_SYSINFO_EHDR with the
    proper address).
    
    While I was at it, I also changed the 32 and 64 bits vDSO's to link at
    their "natural" address of 1Mb instead of 0.  This is the address where
    they are normally mapped in absence of conflict.  By doing so, it should be
    possible to properly prelink one it's been verified to work on glibc.

    [PATCH] ppc64: Fix semantics of __ioremap
    
    This patch fixes ppc64 __ioremap() so that it stops adding implicitely
    _PAGE_GUARDED when the cache is not writeback, and instead, let the callers
    provide the flag they want here.  This allows things like framebuffers to
    explicitely request a non-cacheable and non-guarded mapping which is more
    efficient for that type of memory without side effects.  The patch also
    fixes all current callers to add _PAGE_GUARDED except btext, which is fine

    [PATCH] ppc64: very basic desktop g5 sound support
    
    This patch hacks the current PowerMac Alsa driver to add some basic support
    of analog sound output to some desktop G5s.  It has severe limitations
    though:
    
     - Only 44100Khz 16 bits
     - Only work on G5 models using a TAS3004 analog code, that is early
       single CPU desktops and all dual CPU desktops at this date, but none
       of the more recent ones like iMac G5.
     - It does analog only, no digital/SPDIF support at all, no native
       AC3 support
    
    Better support would require a complete rewrite of the driver (which I am
    working on, but don't hold your breath), to properly support the diversity
    of apple sound HW setup, including dual codecs, several i2s busses, all the
    new codecs used in the new machines, proper clock switching with digital,
    etc etc etc...
    
    This patch applies on top of the other PowerMac sound patches I posted in
    the past couple of days (new powerbook support and sleep fixes).
    
    Note: This is a FAQ entry for PowerMac sound support with TI codecs: They
    have a feature called "DRC" which is automatically enabled for the internal
    speaker (at least when auto mute control is enabled) which will cause your
    sound to fade out to nothing after half a second of playback if you don't
    set a proper "DRC Range" in the mixer.  So if you have a problem like that,
    check alsamixer and raise your DRC Range to something reasonable.
    
    Note2: This patch will also add auto-mute of the speaker when line-out jack
    is used on some earlier desktop G4s (and on the G5) in addition to the
    headphone jack.  If that behaviour isn't what you want, just disable
    auto-muting and use the manual mute controls in alsamixer.

    The following problem was found by Giovambattista Pulcini
    <gpulcini@swintel.it>, who also provided a partial patch, and this has been
    verified by our time guru Gabriel Paubert <paubert@iram.es>.
    
    The problem is that in do_settimeofday() we always set time_state to
    TIME_ERROR and except on two platforms, never re-set it.  This meant that
    ntp_gettime() and ntp_adjtime() always returned TIME_ERROR, incorrectly.
    Based on Gabriel's analysis, time_state is used for leap-second processing,
    and ppc shouldn't be mucking with it.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Support 36-bit physical addressing on e500
    
    To add support for 36-bit physical addressing on e500 the following changes
    have been made.  The changes are generalized to support any physical address
    size larger than 32-bits:
    
    * Allow FSL Book-E parts to use a 64-bit PTE, it is 44-bits of pfn, 20-bits
      of flags.
    
    * Introduced new CPU feature (CPU_FTR_BIG_PHYS) to allow runtime handling of
      updating hardware register (SPRN_MAS7) which holds the upper 32-bits of
      physical address that will be written into the TLB.  This is useful since
      not all e500 cores support 36-bit physical addressing.
    
    * Currently have a pass through implementation of fixup_bigphys_addr
    
    * Moved _PAGE_DIRTY in the 64-bit PTE case to free room for three additional
      storage attributes that may exist in future FSL Book-E cores and updated
      fault handler to copy these bits into the hardware TLBs.

    used if the physical address width is larger than 32-bits, regardless of PTE
    size.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix pte_update for 64-bit PTEs
    
    While the existing pte_update code handled atomically modifying a 64-bit PTE,
    it did not return all 64-bits of the PTE before it was modified.  This causes
    problems in some places that expect the full PTE to be returned, like
    ptep_get_and_clear().
    
    Created a new pte_update function that is conditional on CONFIG_PTE_64BIT.  It
    atomically reads the low PTE word which all PTE flags are required to be in
    and returns a premodified full 64-bit PTE.
    
    Since we now have an explicit 64-bit PTE version of pte_update we can also
    remove the hack that existed to get the low PTE word regardless of size.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix AGP and sleep again
    
    My previous patch that added sleep support for uninorth-agp and some AGP
    "off" stuff in radeonfb and aty128fb is breaking some configs.  More
    specifically, it has problems with rage128 setups since the DRI code for
    these in X doesn't properly re-enable AGP on wakeup or console switch
    (unlike the radeon DRM).
    
    This patch fixes the problem for pmac once for all by using a different
    approach.  The AGP driver "registers" special suspend/resume callbacks with
    some arch code that the fbdev's can later on call to suspend and resume
    AGP, making sure it's resumed back in the same state it was when suspended.
     This is platform specific for now.  It would be too complicated to try to
    do a generic implementation of this at this point due to all sort of weird
    things going on with AGP on other architectures.  We'll re-work that whole
    problem cleanly once we finally merge fbdev's and DRI.
    
    In the meantime, please apply this patch which brings back some r128 based
    laptops into working condition as far as system sleep is concerned.

    [PATCH] ppc32: Fix cpufreq problems
    
    This patch updates the PowerMac cpufreq driver.  It depends on the addition
    of the suspend() method (my previous patch) and on the new flag I defined
    to silence some warnings that are normal for us.
    
    It fixes various issues related to cpufreq on pmac, including some crashes
    on some models when sleeping the machine while in low speed, proper voltage
    control on some newer machines, and adds voltage control on 750FX based G3
    laptops.

    [PATCH] ppc32: fix single-stepping of emulated instructions
    
    On ppc, we emulate instructions that cause alignment exceptions.  If we are
    single-stepping an instruction and it causes an alignment exception, we
    will currently do the next instruction as well before taking the
    single-step exception.  This patch fixes that, so we take the single-step
    exception after emulating the instruction.

    [PATCH] ppc32: oops on kernel altivec assist exceptions
    
    If we should happen to get an altivec assist exception while executing in
    the kernel, we will currently try to handle it and fail, and end up oopsing
    with (apparently) a segfault.  (An altivec assist exception occurs for
    floating-point altivec instructions with denormalized inputs or outputs if
    the altivec unit is in java mode.)
    
    This patch checks explicitly if we are in user mode and prints a useful
    message if not.

    [PATCH] ppc32: improve timebase sync for SMP
    
    Currently the procedure in the ppc32 kernel that synchronizes the timebase
    registers across an SMP powermac system does so by setting both timebases
    to zero.  That is OK at boot but causes problems if done later.  So that we
    can do hotplug CPU on these machines, this patch changes the code so it
    reads the timebase from one CPU and transfers the value to the other CPU.
    (Hotplug CPU is needed for sleep (aka suspend to RAM) to work.)

    [PATCH] ppc32: ppc4xx_pic - add acknowledge when enabling level-sensitive IRQ
    
    This patch adds interrupt acknowledge to the PPC4xx PIC enable_irq
    implementation for level-sensitive IRQ sources.  This helps in cases when
    enable/disable_irq is used in interrupt handlers for hardware, which
    requires IRQ acknowledge to be issued from non-interrupt context (e.g.
    when actual ACK in device needs an I2C transaction).  For such strange
    hardware, interrupt handler disables IRQ and defers actual ACK to some
    other context.  When this happens, IRQ is enabled again.  For
    level-sensitive sources we get spurious triggering right after IRQ is
    enabled.  This patch fixes this.

    only.  Currently, this family simply defaults to the default Netlink socket

    the core userspace policy package, which auto-generates header files.
