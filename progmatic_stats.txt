Normal patch flow for a "simple" change:
	Add a new device id for a usb-to-serial driver:
		Sent on Jan 23:
			https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250123-for-johan-meig-slm828-v1-1-6456996e94a5@arinc9.com
		developer realised it was wrong, and then sent a new version a day later:
			https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250124-for-johan-meig-slm828-v2-1-6b4cd3f6344f@arinc9.com
		developer asked what was up with the change Feb 9 (just over a week later):
			 https://lore.kernel.org/r/6e2c4db7-1325-473b-9999-2b1ada418119@arinc9.com
		maintainer said "it's the middle of the merge window, please wait"
			https://lore.kernel.org/r/Z6Hfx4KBeVHCNQVS@hovoldconsulting.com
		patch was applied on Feb 11 by the maintainer with some small changes:
			https://lore.kernel.org/r/Z6tb7us7t7CmK-zV@hovoldconsulting.com
		Was sent to the USB maintainer on Feb 13 for inclusion in the latest release as a pull request:
			https://lore.kernel.org/r/Z64AhiS7ENsTHAPb@hovoldconsulting.com
		and taken the same day.

		Was sent on to Linus as part of a larger pull request on Feb 16:
			https://lore.kernel.org/r/Z7IAH0twfNXO-j_m@kroah.com
		and was part of the 6.14-rc3 release that same day.

		Then it got picked up on Feb 18 to be included in the next round of stable kernel releases and put out for larger review as part of the stable release process on Feb 19:
			https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250219082601.683263930@linuxfoundation.org
		and then was part of the 6.13.4 release which happened on Feb 21:
			https://lore.kernel.org/r/2025022126-proxy-bribe-10d1@gregkh

		So, non-critical bugfix, normal device id, took 27 days to get
		out into a stable kernel releae (and 1 week of the delay was
		due to the merge window being open when no new patches could be
		applied).

Normal patch flow for a "complex" change:
